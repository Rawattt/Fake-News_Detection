2,"UNITED NATIONS: India has co-sponsored a UN General Assembly resolution that called for a fair, transparent and equitable access to essential medical supplies and any future vaccines developed to fight Covid-19 that has claimed over 177,000 lives and infected more than 2.5 million people. The 193-Member General Assembly adopted the Mexico-drafted resolution 'International cooperation to ensure global access to medicines, vaccines and medical equipment to face Covid-19' by consensus on Monday. Pakistan was among the small minority of nations that did not sponsor the resolution. India was among the 179 nations co-sponsoring the resolution that called for ensuring ""fair, transparent, equitable, efficient and timely access to and distribution of preventive tools, laboratory testing, reagents and supporting materials, essential medical supplies, new diagnostics, drugs and future Covid-19 vaccines"" to all nations, particular developing countries. ""India has proactively engaged in supporting global availability of medicines and drugs by means of international cooperation and development partnerships. Also, we are facilitating the sourcing of global supplies of multilateral agencies such as UNICEF in the face of Covid-19. We were therefore glad to co-sponsor this important initiative,"" India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin told PTI. India has been at the forefront of sending essential medical supplies and medicines such as anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to several nations, with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres saying he ""salutes"" nations like India that are helping other countries in their fight against the devastating pandemic. A number of countries, including the US, Mauritius and Seychelles have already received the drug. In its neighborhood, India is sending the drug to Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, The Maldives, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Pakistan said it has some reservations on the resolution drafted by Mexico. ""We regret that the draft resolution could not include reference to ensure access to information, preventive and other health care for all persons arbitrarily deprived of their liberty especially those in regions under foreign occupation,"" Pakistan said in its explanation of vote sent to the President of the General Assembly Tijjani Muhammad-Bande. The resolution, which received US support, was the second document to be adopted by the General Assembly on the Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution, co-sponsored by 188 nations including India, calling for intensified international cooperation to defeat the pandemic that is causing ""severe disruption to societies and economies"". The latest resolution also acknowledged the ""crucial leading role"" played by the World Health Organization, which has come under constant attack by the Trump administration over its handling of the outbreak. It recognised the importance of international cooperation and effective multilateralism in helping to ensure that all States have in place effective national protective measures, access to and flow of vital medical supplies, medicines and vaccines in order to minimise negative effects in all affected states and to avoid relapses of the pandemic. It encouraged Member States to work in partnership with all relevant stakeholders to increase research and development funding for vaccines and medicines, leverage digital technologies, and strengthen scientific international cooperation necessary to combat COVID-19 and to bolster coordination, including with the private sector, towards rapid development, manufacturing and distribution of diagnostics, antiviral medicines, personal protective equipment and vaccines, adhering to the objectives of efficacy, safety, equity, accessibility, and affordability. It calls on member states and other relevant stakeholders to immediately take steps to prevent, within their respective legal frameworks, speculation and ""undue stockpiling"" that may hinder access to safe, effective and affordable essential medicines, vaccines, personal protective equipment and medical equipment required to effectively address Covid-19. The resolution requested the Secretary-General, in close collaboration with the World Health Organization, to take the necessary steps to effectively coordinate efforts of the United Nations system to promote and ensure global access to medicines, vaccines and medical equipment needed to face Covid-19. According to estimates by Johns Hopkins University, there are more than 2.5 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the world and over 177,000 people have died from the virus. The US is the most hit by the pandemic, with more than 824,000 people infected and over 45,000 deaths.

7,"NEW DELHI: Controversial given the high risk of deaths, a coronavirus strategy discarded by the UK is being touted as the solution for young countries like India. The herd immunity strategy, which would allow a majority of the population to gain resistance to the virus by becoming infected and then recovering, could result in less economic devastation and human suffering than restrictive lockdowns designed to stop the virus's spread, a number of experts have begun to argue in the nation of 1.3 billion people.  ""No country can afford a prolonged period of lockdowns, and least of all a country like India,"" said Jayaprakash Muliyil, a prominent Indian epidemiologist. ""You may be able to reach a point of herd immunity without infection really catching up with the elderly. And when the herd immunity reaches a sufficient number the outbreak will stop, and the elderly are also safe."" A team of researchers at Princeton University and the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, a public health advocacy group based in New Delhi and Washington, has identified India as a place where this strategy could be successful because its disproportionately young population would face less risk of hospitalization and death. They said allowing the virus to be unleashed in a controlled way for the next seven months would give 60% of the country's people immunity by November, and thus halt the disease. Mortality could be limited as the virus spreads compared to European nations like Italy given that 93.5% of the Indian population is younger than 65, they said, though no death toll projections were released. The radical proposal underscores the challenges that poorer developing countries — including nations like Indonesia and some in sub-Saharan Africa — face in curbing the epidemic using the lockdown measures that have been adopted by advanced economies. The impossibility of social distancing in crowded living conditions like in many cities and villages in India, the lack of testing kits to detect infections and the human suffering that occurs in lockdowns suggests a different path may be needed in these places. To do this, the Princeton and CDDEP team recommends lifting India's strict lockdown — which has been extended to May 3 — and letting most of the population younger than 60 return to normal life, though social distancing still would be encouraged, masks would be required and large gatherings would be banned. The reopening would be accompanied by an effort to test as many people as possible and isolate confirmed and suspected cases. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given no indication it plans to adopt such a strategy. Yet the government has laid out criteria that effectively rations coronavirus tests, limiting them to the very sick or most at risk. Critics who suspect the disease has spread much more widely than the official numbers suggest say the government's restrictive criteria amounts to allowing the disease to spread. ""In some sense, you are saying, we will let them get infected and recover, and take care only of those who are sick,"" said T Sundararaman, the New Delhi-based global coordinator of the People's Health Movement, a public health group. ""That's the policy, that's what it amounts to."" The government has maintained its testing criteria gives an accurate tally of India's number of cases, and says the disease is not spreading untracked in the community. Nevertheless, as India has ramped up testing, it is finding more cases each day, bringing the nationwide tally to 19,984, with 640 deaths, as of April 22. But if questions remain as to the extent and severity of India's outbreak, the costs of the government's lockdown are clear. Local governments have had to set up camps to house 1.25 million migrants who left cities when they lost work, while food camps feed 7.5 million daily wage earners also rendered destitute by the lockdown. There are already signs these stopgap measures are starting to fray. ""We're dealing with a trade-off against starvation, hunger, all this other stuff,"" said Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the CDDEP and a Princeton researcher. By allowing the coronavirus to spread in a controlled way, ""undoubtedly there will be deaths, but it will be much smaller this way, and it opens us up for business by November,"" he said. But the strategy has already proved controversial internationally. The UK adopted and then abandoned it early in the pandemic after projections showed its health care system would be overwhelmed by the resulting hospitalizations. That brief dalliance is still being blamed for the British government's slow response in testing for the virus. Risky strategyEven in a country like India with a young population, the concept has inherent risks. Allowing people to become infected will inevitably bring many more patients to hospitals. The researchers say India will have to urgently expand critical care and isolation-bed capacity to ensure that multiple waves of patients don't become casualties before herd immunity is reached. Another risk is that India's worst-in the-world air pollution and high rates of hypertension and diabetes have compromised young people's health, meaning that mortality from the virus could be higher than expected. People may let their guards down and fail to follow social distancing guidelines. ""I would worry that it would relax concerns of younger individuals, who still remain at substantial risk themselves,"" Jason Andrews, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, said in an email. ""The messaging in particular may lead younger people to perceive themselves as at lower risk than they are, and to fail to understand their potential role in transmission."" And given the novel coronavirus only made its debut in humans some time late last year, there's still a lot that's unknown. Immunity from the virus may be a more complex process than expected. One group of researchers estimated as much as 82% of the population would have to be infected before herd immunity is reached. ""My view is there are a number of questions about whether it can work,"" said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University's TH Chan School of Public Health. ""The main questions being how much immunity do we need in the population, and how much immunity does each person get as a result of infection."" Then there's also the question of whether it's possible to wall off the higher-risk portion of the population in densely packed India, where multiple generations commonly live under one roof. Ultimately, the researchers lobbying for the strategy argue that cultivating herd immunity may be the best of various bad options. ""I think eventually all countries will follow this Indian model,"" Laxminarayan said. ""Because otherwise we are going to be in lockdown on and off all the way through until June of next year.""

10,"NEW DELHI: With indications emerging that aviation and Metro train services may be first modes of transport to resume after lockdown, CISF has formulated post-lockdown safety measures for the two key sectors secured by it — airports and Delhi Metro. While business continuity plan for safe air travel was forwarded on April 8 to the officers in-charge of security at various airports, CISF is now finalising similar norms for Delhi Metro service, including restricting the number of entrances at each metro station to just one or two, setting up sanitising tunnels, mass thermal scanning of commuters and marking seats/spots in coaches that must remain empty to maintain social distancing. “We had earlier framed guidelines of safe air travel post-lockdown. Now CISF is also formulating SOPs for post-lockdown safety of metro sector. We are working on putting in place a system that will allow an immediate feedback on any passenger in the crowd who has high temperature. Individual reading of of commuters with a hand-held temperature gun is not ideal given the high metro traffic. The thermal scanner will send out an alarm upon detecting high temperature in a crowd, enabling rapid feedback and cutting response time,” CISF director general Rajesh Ranjan told TOI. TOI has learnt that airlines may resume operations on a limited scale after May 3 though a final call will be taken closer to that date. Seating plan in aircraft may require passengers to be seated in a Z-formation, leaving two seats in each row empty, said a source. Sanitising tunnels have been recommended by CISF for both airports and metro. CISF SOPs on preventing Covid-19 spread in metro, likely to be submitted to DMRC early next week, also look to limit entrances to each metro station to just one or maximum two. “This will make security screening easier. We will also set a protocol on businesses operating from metro stations, which will require their staff to wear masks, common surfaces to be sanitised and careful handling of cargo inflow and outflow,” said Ranjan. While DRDO model of sanitising tunnel may be adopted, CISF is still studying which chemicals can be sprayed on those passing through the tunnel without adverse health effects associated with long and frequent exposure. With running metro coaches with a lesser carrying capacity inevitable post-lockdown, spaces in between two passenger seats may be marked with a ‘cross’ to indicate that they must be left vacant. Also giving paramount importance to safety of CISF personnel deployed at airports and in metro stations, the force shall be ensuring appropriate social distancing measures. CISF is augmenting its stock of face-masks, hand gloves, alcohol based sanitisers, PPEs, so as to have sufficient numbers available for 2-3 months. An option is to use a modified version of PPE, which possibly covers full face, in high-risk areas. Quick reaction teams handling law and order situation at airports may be given PPEs. ""CISF personnel have been doing exemplary work in helping the authorities fight Covid-19 and large-heartedly offering food, masks and rations to the needy from their own stocks. Their safety and fitness is our clear priority,” said CISF DG. DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

17,"NEW DELHI: With indications emerging that aviation and Metro train services may be first modes of transport to resume after lockdown, CISF has formulated post-lockdown safety measures for the two key sectors secured by it — airports and Delhi Metro. While business continuity plan for safe air travel was forwarded on April 8 to the officers in-charge of security at various airports, CISF is now finalising similar norms for Delhi Metro service, including restricting the number of entrances at each metro station to just one or two, setting up sanitising tunnels, mass thermal scanning of commuters and marking seats/spots in coaches that must remain empty to maintain social distancing. “We had earlier framed guidelines of safe air travel post-lockdown. Now CISF is also formulating SOPs for post-lockdown safety of metro sector. We are working on putting in place a system that will allow an immediate feedback on any passenger in the crowd who has high temperature. Individual reading of of commuters with a hand-held temperature gun is not ideal given the high metro traffic. The thermal scanner will send out an alarm upon detecting high temperature in a crowd, enabling rapid feedback and cutting response time,” CISF director general Rajesh Ranjan told TOI. TOI has learnt that airlines may resume operations on a limited scale after May 3 though a final call will be taken closer to that date. Seating plan in aircraft may require passengers to be seated in a Z-formation, leaving two seats in each row empty, said a source. Sanitising tunnels have been recommended by CISF for both airports and metro. CISF SOPs on preventing Covid-19 spread in metro, likely to be submitted to DMRC early next week, also look to limit entrances to each metro station to just one or maximum two. “This will make security screening easier. We will also set a protocol on businesses operating from metro stations, which will require their staff to wear masks, common surfaces to be sanitised and careful handling of cargo inflow and outflow,” said Ranjan. While DRDO model of sanitising tunnel may be adopted, CISF is still studying which chemicals can be sprayed on those passing through the tunnel without adverse health effects associated with long and frequent exposure. With running metro coaches with a lesser carrying capacity inevitable post-lockdown, spaces in between two passenger seats may be marked with a ‘cross’ to indicate that they must be left vacant. Also giving paramount importance to safety of CISF personnel deployed at airports and in metro stations, the force shall be ensuring appropriate social distancing measures. CISF is augmenting its stock of face-masks, hand gloves, alcohol based sanitisers, PPEs, so as to have sufficient numbers available for 2-3 months. An option is to use a modified version of PPE, which possibly covers full face, in high-risk areas. Quick reaction teams handling law and order situation at airports may be given PPEs. ""CISF personnel have been doing exemplary work in helping the authorities fight Covid-19 and large-heartedly offering food, masks and rations to the needy from their own stocks. Their safety and fitness is our clear priority,” said CISF DG. DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

24,"BENGALURU: Social media users and platforms like Wikipedia, Quora and Twitter are waging a war against communalism in the wake of the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi that spawned Covid-19 clusters across the country. On Tuesday, #IslamaphobiainIndia was among top-trending topics on Twitter with over 129,000 tweets even as fresh calls were made to boycott Bollywood singer Sonu Nigam, currently living in Dubai, after his old tweets objecting to azaan (call to prayer), resurfaced. The singer has since deleted his Twitter account. Another old tweet that gained traction in the past week was a post by MP Tejasvi Surya written in 2015 which contained objectionable comments on Arab women. Twitter recently suspended actor Kangana Ranaut’s sister Rangoli Chandel's account for comments she made following the attack on a medical team in Moradabad last week. Soon after, users had called for suspension of wrestler Babita Phogat's account. Much of the outrage is being led by social media users in the Arab world. In some instances, netizens in the Gulf countries who published blatantly communal posts have lost their jobs and may even face police action for hate speech. One such post by an Indian man based in the United Arab Emirates caught the attention of Princess Hend Al Qassimi. Sharing the anti-Tablighi tweet, he said ""anyone that is openly racist and discriminatory in the UAE will be fined and made to leave."" The CEO of a Sharjah-headquartered company also wrote an apology for certain posts. In another case, a team leader at Dubai-headquartered Emrill Services was fired after multiple users tagged the company on his post blaming a particular community for spreading coronavirus. Stuart Harrison, CEO of Emrill Services, said the company has “a zero-tolerance policy towards such hate crimes”. Wikipedia too has deleted a page called ‘2020 Tablighi Jamaat coronavirus hotspot in Delhi’ with founder Jimmy Wales saying ""the article was incredibly poorly written and had zero sources.” Quora has removed several inflammatory questions on the site. A Facebook spokesperson told TOI that their third-party fact-checking partners were monitoring misinformation being shared online. “Our enforcement measures are targeted to prevent harm and keep people from attempting to incite offline violence. We encourage anyone who sees this content to immediately report it to us for review.” Content that is not flagged off often slips through. Social media platforms do not have sufficient manpower to keep a check on all content generated. Artificial intelligence can pick up words, slurs or racist speech but doesn't work half as well for identifying images, cartoons or videos (unless its graphic violence or sexually explicit content), according to a content moderator with Twitter. N Ramesh, an editor on Wikipedia, said their model works differently from Quora, Facebook or Twitter. “Here, we keep trolls out right from the start. Each wikipedia page has a different layer of security depending on the tendency for it to be vandalised.” DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

""These are extraordinary times,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the Center for Science and Environment, a research and advocacy organization in New Delhi.

The stringent lockdown measures that are set to be lifted on May 3 also have had an effect on India's rivers. Pictures of pristine clear waters of the Ganges, India's longest river considered holy by Hindus, were enthusiastically shared on social media a few weeks into the lockdown. India's pollution monitoring body said the water had even become fit for bathing in some areas, according to real-time monitors placed along the 2,575-kilometer (1,600-mile) -long river. A recent analysis by the Delhi Pollution Control Board found that the quality of the Yamuna River flowing along New Delhi has also improved during the lockdown. The report cited a decrease in runoffs from 28 industrial clusters and less trash. ""The lockdown has clearly told us what the main sources of pollution are,"" said Vimlendu Jha, an environmentalist and founder of Swechha, a non-governmental organization helping youth fight climate change. ""Effluents are forced into our river bodies, and that is major reason why our rivers are black."" Jha and other experts warn that the environmental improvements may be short-lived as the government eventually lifts the lockdown and rampant economic activity resumes. ""How was a lockdown for just a few weeks able to achieve what governments could not for decades?"" said Jha, who believes authorities should study data collected during the lockdown to devise better environmental policies. Roychowdhury suggested private workplaces that shifted their work online during the lockdown should institutionalize working from home to consider the impact of commuting on air pollution.

28,"NEW DELHI: The West Bengal government has said ""it is not a fact"" that there was no cooperation with the Central team deputed to assess the Covid-19 situation in the state and gave an assurance that it will abide by all Union government orders on lockdown. The assurance came hours after the Centre accused the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government of obstructing a Central team deputed to assess the coronavirus ground situation. In a letter to Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said it was not a fact that the two Inter Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) have not been provided with any cooperation by the state government since he had two meetings with one team and also was in touch with the other. ""This is to convey my highest assurances for the implementation of the orders of central government issued under the Disaster Management Act as well as the directions of the Honb'le Supreme Court,"" the state chief secretary told the union home secretary. A home ministry spokesperson welcomed the West Bengal government's assurance of cooperation to the two visiting teams. The West Bengal chief secretary sent the letter Tuesday night, hours after the central government had directed the state government not to obstruct working of the two central teams. The Centre had also accused the West Bengal government of not cooperating with the central teams and also said that the state government was specifically restraining the teams from interacting with health workers and touring the affected areas. The West Bengal chief secretary wrote: ""It is not a fact that the IMCT has not been provided with any cooperation by the state government"". ""In fact the teams had arrived without any prior consultation with us and, therefore, there was neither such opportunity to provide any logistic support as envisaged in the order dated April 19 nor the team asked for any help,"" he said. The chief secretary said the team, visiting Kolkata and nearby districts, went to the BSF guest house in Kolkata and the team, which is visiting Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Kalimpong, went to the SSB guest house in Siliguri on their own. ""In this connection, this is to inform that the IMCT in Kolkata led by Apurva Chandra met me in my office on April 20 and had an interaction about the implementation of lockdown measures and other efforts of the state government to contain and combat Covid-19. ""I am also in touch with Vineet Joshi of IMCT at Siliguri and have apprised him about the steps taken by the state government along with sharing of our reports on mail,"" Sinha said. He also said that he had another meeting with the team in Kolkata on April 21 at their place of stay at the BSF mess, Kolkata and shared the up to date reports. ""They are visiting different parts of the city to make an on the spot assessment of the implementation of the lockdown measures"" the chief secretary said. Sinha also referred to his telephonic discussions with Bhalla on April 21 and highlighted ""the pro-active steps taken by the state government for effective implementation of lockdown measures to contain the spread of Covid-19"". A total of six IMCTs have been deputed to Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal to review the implementation of the lockdown measures after making on-spot assessment of the situation prevailing in identified select districts. Two of these teams have been sent to West Bengal- one team to Kolkata, Howrah, North 24 Parganas and East Medinipur and the other team to Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Kalimpong. The first team was led by Chandra while the second team was led by Joshi, both additional secretary rank officers in the central government. The teams comprise public health specialists and officers of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), whose expertise can be leveraged by the state government for management of Covid-19 pandemic. The teams were deputed under the authority conferred on the Central Government under Section 35 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 which states that ""..the central government shall take all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the purpose of Disaster Management"". Bhalla, in his Tuesday's letter, also quoted a recent Supreme Court observation that the state governments will faithfully comply with the directives and orders issued by the Union of India in letter and spirit in the interest of public safety. The said observations of the Apex Court, the home secretary said, must be treated as directions and faithfully complied with. The home ministry had on Monday said Covid-19 situation is ""especially serious"" in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata and a few other places in West Bengal, and violation of lockdown measures risk the spread of the novel Coronavirus. West Bengal's ruling Trinamool Congress, however, dubbed the visit of the central teams as ""adventure tourism"" and asked why such delegations were not sent to states with much higher numbers of infections and hotspots. TMC MPs Derek O'Brien and Sudip Bandyopadhyay Tuesday claimed that chief minister Mamata Banerjee was informed about the teams' visit three hours after their arrival in the state, which they said was unacceptable.

29,"NEW DELHI: A full-scale political battle has broken out between the BJP-led Centre and the Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government, sparked off by the “unannounced” landing of a central team of officials in Kolkata on Monday morning. With West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee viewing the move as an attack on the federal scheme of governance, the TMC accused the Centre of “playing politics at a time when states and the Centre are expected to work together to combat coronavirus”. Banerjee shot off a letter to PM Narendra Modi protesting “breaking of federal norms”. READ ALSO | Bengal obstructing Centre’s Covid-19 teams, says MHAAddressing an online press conference on Tuesday, TMC parliamentary leaders Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O’Brien questioned the Centre’s “intent”. “Why are opposition-governed states like West Bengal being put on targeted watch when states under BJP like Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, or even states like Tamil Nadu and Telangana, governed by friendly parties, with higher positive cases are not being monitored by the Centre,” they asked. “Unfortunately, when Bengal and all other states are fighting coronavirus, the Centre is fighting the states,” O’Brien said, adding, “The Centre refused to call off the budget session of Parliament and delayed a lockdown when the virus was spreading, paying no heed to TMC’s warning on social distancing to be observed, apparently to install a BJP government in Madhya Pradesh.” He further said, “It is a health emergency. Let’s fight it together, not as a state or Centre. Let’s get back to politics after this is over.” Bandopadhyay said, “People want to know what the central ministerial team is looking for, what it has found and why it has not consulted with the chief minister or any state government official on their visit.” He added that the state was coordinating with the Centre and following every guideline. “So, what happened suddenly?” he asked. Asked whether people would suffer if the war against coronavirus got caught in political wrangling, Bandopadhyay said, “Hopefully, good sense will prevail.

30,"NEW DELHI: The West Bengal administration’s refusal to provide assistance to the two Inter-Ministerial Central Teams despatched to assist the state can have serious security implications if provisions of the Disaster Management Act are examined as they empower the Centre to deploy military or paramilitary to enforce guidelines issued by the home ministry in any part of the country. Given the sensitivity of the Covid-19 situation, the Centre may choose persuasion or even a hard nudge rather than invoke the more stringent provisions of the law. As it is, the Trinamool Congress has raised the issue of federalism and an emotive outburst of populist emotions will worry the Centre. But at present, the DM Act has been invoked to put the country under lockdown till May 3. The Act overrides all existing laws in the country. In addition, Section 35(2)(f) of the Act empowers the Centre to deploy military or any central paramilitary force to effectively enforce implementation of the guidelines issued under the Act. States are bound to comply with central directives and “make available their resources” to the central team for “responding promptly and effectively to any disaster in the state”. In case of West Bengal, preliminary reports received by the home ministry had indicated “violence on frontline healthcare professionals, complete violations of social distancing norms outside banks, PDS shops and in market places and movement of private and commercial vehicles with passengers in urban areas”. Though in its communication to the chief secretary, the Centre only quoted Sections 35(1), 35(2)(a), 35(2)(e) and 35(2)(i) that talk about coordination, cooperation and securing effective implementation of the DM Act, there are other provisions that provide for arrest of a state official if he or she refuses to abide by the central directives. If there is a showdown between the Centre and states in implementation of disaster management guidelines, the Act empowers the Centre for “deployment of naval, military and air force, other armed forces of the Union or any other civilian personnel as may be required for the purposes of this Act”. While Sections 38 and 39 of the Act make it compulsory that resources of the state are made available to the central team for “responding promptly and effectively” to the disaster, Sections 55 and 56 provide for punishment of up to one year and with fine on failure of any officer of the state “in duty or his connivance at the contravention of the provisions of the Act”.

The Centre had previously written to West Bengal pointing out that social distancing was being slackly implemented. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the state would implement curbs with a ""human face"". In its previous communication, the home ministry had pointed to reports that the police were allowing religious congregations and people were thronging vegetable, fish and meat markets in several areas. Bhalla said West Bengal’s refusal to assist the teams “amounts to obstructing the implementation of the orders issued by the central government under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and equally binding directions of the Supreme Court”. “You are, therefore, directed to comply with the MHA order dated April 19, 2020, and make all necessary arrangements for the IMCTs to carry out such responsibilities as have been entrusted to them,” he wrote.

The ‘Times Fact India Outbreak Report’ looks at three different possibilities and suggests that India could see the number of coronavirus cases crossing 75,000 around May 22. The team built three models to predict the progression of the coronavirus. Each model provides an estimate of how the outbreak could unfold under different conditions and provides insights on how the government and health infrastructure can respond to the crisis. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesThe report used three models: the percentage model, the time series model and the Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered (SEIR) model. The percentage model uses trends in the spread of the disease in Italy and the US, and applies them onto India to predict its trajectory. Blog: Level the field - News producers can’t keep incurring the costs while digital platforms drain away profitsCoronavirus outbreak: Complete coverageThe time series model takes into consideration data across time periods in China and South Korea, and adapts them to India’s data. The SEIR model is based on an estimation of reproduction rate of the virus, which is the average number of people each positive person infects.

33,"NEW DELHI: With states complaining that the recently acquired rapid testing kits were delivering misleading and inaccurate results, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday advised all states to stop using the antibody test for Covid-19 for two days until its teams investigated the functioning of the kits. The council said it was investigating the issue as some states had reported huge variations — ranging between 6% and 71% — in test results from rapid antibody kits which it said was unacceptable and may need to be replaced, which will be a setback to the government's plan to use rapid tests for surveillance and tracking trends, though not for diagnostics. On Tuesday morning, Rajasthan — the first state in the country to conduct rapid tests for Covid-19 — decided to stop using the kit any further as it was found that the results were inaccurate and did not correlate with the results of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. This also triggered a reaction across the country with many other states discontinuing the testing. In a tweet late on Tuesday, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said: ""I had earlier suggested to GOI (government of India) that a centralised mechanism with proper guidelines of quality check may be developed for the procurement of medical equipment. Unfortunately this was not accepted. Had this suggestion been accepted, failure of Rapid Test kits could have been avoided. We have written to ICMR for the same."" However, well-placed sources said the tests may not be at fault and might not have been correctly used. ""The kits are not faulty,"" an official familiar with the testing strategy said. ""The use of these kits for diagnosis is at fault. The proper test for Covid is the RT-PCR test. It is possible that states may have resorted to a short-cut in seeing them as diagnostic tests,"" he added. Thanks to this, India’s testing rate has dropped from 35,000-odd on Monday to 27,500 on Tuesday as states are using testing infrastructure for antibody tests. ICMR is expected to issue a detailed clarification soon. There have also been reports that the temperatures needed for the rapid tests have not been observed. More on Covid-19  Coronavirus pandemic: Complete Coverage 21-day lockdown: What will stay open and what won't How to quarantine yourself at home Trust the newspaper for your daily verified news The kits had arrived last week after several delays and have been sourced from three companies based in China. In the first batch, some 3,00,000 kits arrived close to two weeks after they were due. In all, 6,50,000 are to be delivered with more in the pipeline by way of domestic operations in collaboration with foreign firms and other orders that have been placed. The kits are being sent to states based on their requirements. There were complaints from states with the kits meant to be used in hotspots and red zones as a supplement to the polymerase tests that are much more reliable but take more time as it’s are a four-stage procedure to be conducted in labs. ""On Monday, we received a complaint from one state about less detection through rapid antibody test kits. So we asked around three states on Tuesday and found that among positive samples of RT-PCR, there is too much variation in rapid antibody tests,"" said ICMR’s head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, Dr R R Gangakhedkar. ""In some places, 6% to 71% of RT-PCR positive samples were positive,"" he added. ICMR has decided to send eight different teams for testing and validating the kits in the field over the next two days, after which it will issue a fresh advisory on the use of rapid antibody test kits. ""If problems are detected in batches, we will tell the company and can ask them to replace the batches,"" Dr Gangakhedkar said, while asking states to halt testing through the rapid antibody kit till then. While concerns about level of accuracy of rapid antibody tests were raised earlier too, ICMR and the health ministry maintained that the tests were to be used only for surveillance and monitoring of trends. ICMR has recommended only RT-PCR tests for testing individuals who are Covid-19 suspects, which it said was the gold standard. ""This is not a good thing because when such a huge variation is seen, we need to investigate further even if it is the first generation of the test,"" Dr Gangakhedkar said. He, however, said rapid antibody test was a new and first-generation test and would require time to develop further and perform better in new diseases like Covid-19. Highly placed sources in the government told TOI that ICMR had clarified (in government meetings) that rapid test kits show positive reports only after seven days — the period a body needs to generate antibodies that can be detected. They also said that purchases of these kits were made directly by ICMR. ""ICMR was directly involved in procurement of rapid test kits from both China and South Korea. The vendors were approved by the local government,"" said a source. In Rajasthan, a committee submitted its report following a study conducted on rapid tests. ""The SMS Medical College submitted its report to us and they found that those who tested positive in the PCR test have been found negative for Covid-19 in the rapid test. When we correlated the results of PCR and rapid tests, we found that only 5.4% were matching. Ideally, the matching should be at least 90%,"" said Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma. Maharashtra put a last-minute stop on using the rapid test kits. The state had received 75,000 kits and was planning to carry out tests among healthcare workers and subsequently in hotspots such as Mumbai’s Dharavi. The BMC had plans to start testing medical workers using the rapid kits from Wednesday. Dr Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner of the National Health Mission, said that they have decided to wait for 48 hours for the ICMR’s new advisory. West Bengal decided to put rapid tests on hold till it got a clearance from ICMR, Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim said late on Tuesday. Bengal had tested 78 people on Monday and another 220 on Tuesday. Punjab, which was amongst the first states to flag the issue of low accuracy, decided not to use kits provided by the central government. To check the accuracy of the kits, Punjab principal health secretary Anurag Agarwal on April 19 got a survey conducted in Mohali and Jalandhar, the worst-hit districts in the state, by testing positive cases. Random sampling among the general public was also done. In both the categories, a majority of samples collected showed false negative and positive results. In Uttar Pradesh, state surveillance officer for Covid-19 Vikasendu Agarwal said: ""UP will put on hold use of rapid kits after ICMR's observation."" UP had recently used the kits to screen over 10,500 children who returned from Kota. The kits were also used for surveillance in hotspots of Gautam Buddh Nagar. Gujarat too has put its use on hold. ""There are two confirmatory strips — IgM and IgG — in these kits. Both are to turn positive to confirm a case. But in certain cases, only one of the two strips shows results while the other strip fails and hence the case remains inconclusive,"" said principal secretary (health) Jayanthi Ravi. Tamil Nadu, which ordered four lakh rapid antibody testing kits, has put its orders on hold since Saturday. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation managing director P Umanath said his team was re-negotiating the price and re-evaluating the stock required after the ICMR said the tests cannot be used for diagnostic purposes. While Assam and Haryana too have suspended use of these kits, states like Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are yet to begin using them.

37,"NEW DELHI: A full-scale political battle has broken out between the BJP-led Centre and the Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government, sparked off by the “unannounced” landing of a central team of officials in Kolkata on Monday morning. With West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee viewing the move as an attack on the federal scheme of governance, the TMC accused the Centre of “playing politics at a time when states and the Centre are expected to work together to combat coronavirus”. Banerjee shot off a letter to PM Narendra Modi protesting “breaking of federal norms”. READ ALSO | Bengal obstructing Centre’s Covid-19 teams, says MHAAddressing an online press conference on Tuesday, TMC parliamentary leaders Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O’Brien questioned the Centre’s “intent”. “Why are opposition-governed states like West Bengal being put on targeted watch when states under BJP like Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, or even states like Tamil Nadu and Telangana, governed by friendly parties, with higher positive cases are not being monitored by the Centre,” they asked. “Unfortunately, when Bengal and all other states are fighting coronavirus, the Centre is fighting the states,” O’Brien said, adding, “The Centre refused to call off the budget session of Parliament and delayed a lockdown when the virus was spreading, paying no heed to TMC’s warning on social distancing to be observed, apparently to install a BJP government in Madhya Pradesh.” He further said, “It is a health emergency. Let’s fight it together, not as a state or Centre. Let’s get back to politics after this is over.” Bandopadhyay said, “People want to know what the central ministerial team is looking for, what it has found and why it has not consulted with the chief minister or any state government official on their visit.” He added that the state was coordinating with the Centre and following every guideline. “So, what happened suddenly?” he asked. Asked whether people would suffer if the war against coronavirus got caught in political wrangling, Bandopadhyay said, “Hopefully, good sense will prevail. The Centre will restrain itself in future and will consult state governments for comprehensive and well-structured moves to fight coronavirus and state governments will cooperate.” DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

38,"NEW DELHI: The West Bengal administration’s refusal to provide assistance to the two Inter-Ministerial Central Teams despatched to assist the state can have serious security implications if provisions of the Disaster Management Act are examined as they empower the Centre to deploy military or paramilitary to enforce guidelines issued by the home ministry in any part of the country. Given the sensitivity of the Covid-19 situation, the Centre may choose persuasion or even a hard nudge rather than invoke the more stringent provisions of the law. As it is, the Trinamool Congress has raised the issue of federalism and an emotive outburst of populist emotions will worry the Centre. But at present, the DM Act has been invoked to put the country under lockdown till May 3. The Act overrides all existing laws in the country. In addition, Section 35(2)(f) of the Act empowers the Centre to deploy military or any central paramilitary force to effectively enforce implementation of the guidelines issued under the Act. States are bound to comply with central directives and “make available their resources” to the central team for “responding promptly and effectively to any disaster in the state”. In case of West Bengal, preliminary reports received by the home ministry had indicated “violence on frontline healthcare professionals, complete violations of social distancing norms outside banks, PDS shops and in market places and movement of private and commercial vehicles with passengers in urban areas”. Though in its communication to the chief secretary, the Centre only quoted Sections 35(1), 35(2)(a), 35(2)(e) and 35(2)(i) that talk about coordination, cooperation and securing effective implementation of the DM Act, there are other provisions that provide for arrest of a state official if he or she refuses to abide by the central directives. If there is a showdown between the Centre and states in implementation of disaster management guidelines, the Act empowers the Centre for “deployment of naval, military and air force, other armed forces of the Union or any other civilian personnel as may be required for the purposes of this Act”. While Sections 38 and 39 of the Act make it compulsory that resources of the state are made available to the central team for “responding promptly and effectively” to the disaster, Sections 55 and 56 provide for punishment of up to one year and with fine on failure of any officer of the state “in duty or his connivance at the contravention of the provisions of the Act”.

39,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday said while Maharashtra and Rajasthan were fully cooperating with inter-ministerial teams sent to boost anti-Covid-19 actions, the West Bengal government had restrained the teams sent to Kolkata and Jalpaiguri from functioning, escalating the political battle with Trinamool Congress. Home ministry spokesperson Punya Salila Srivastava said the West Bengal government's actions amounted to obstructing implementation of the order issued on Monday under the Disaster Management Act where state authorities were asked to make arrangements for the IMCTs (inter-ministerial central teams) to assess the ground situation. READ ALSO | Didi hits back, says attack on federal norms; TMC questions Centre’s intent“It has been brought to the notice of this ministry that both the IMCTs, at Kolkata and Jalpaiguri respectively, have not been provided with the requisite cooperation by the state and local authorities.

More on Covid-19  Coronavirus pandemic: Complete Coverage 21-day lockdown: What will stay open and what won't How to quarantine yourself at home Trust the newspaper for your daily verified news The war of words, however, became heated with Trinamool leader Abhishek Banerjee tweeting, ""You cripple West Bengal with faulty kits from ICMR and then send IMCTs to monitor its performance while keeping the state government in the dark. In the name of combating the Covid-19 crisis, you're playing with the lives of Bengalis while your leaders use skewed testing numbers for fake propaganda."" The Centre had previously written to West Bengal pointing out that social distancing was being slackly implemented. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the state would implement curbs with a ""human face"". In its previous communication, the home ministry had pointed to reports that the police were allowing religious congregations and people were thronging vegetable, fish and meat markets in several areas. Bhalla said West Bengal’s refusal to assist the teams “amounts to obstructing the implementation of the orders issued by the central government under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and equally binding directions of the Supreme Court”. “You are, therefore, directed to comply with the MHA order dated April 19, 2020, and make all necessary arrangements for the IMCTs to carry out such responsibilities as have been entrusted to them,” he wrote. Two central teams have been deputed to West Bengal to review implementation of lockdown measures in identified districts. The teams are led by additional secretary-level officers and comprise senior public health professionals and NDMA officers, “whose expertise can be leveraged by the state government for management of Covid-19 pandemic”, said the home secretary. Bhalla reminded the state government that the teams were deputed under the authority conferred on the central government under Section 35 of the Disaster Management Act which states that “the central government shall take all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the purpose of disaster management”. He also drew attention to the SC’s observation in its order on March 31 that state governments will faithfully comply with the directives and orders issued by the Union of India in letter and spirit in the interest of public safety. “The said observations of the Supreme Court must be treated as directions and faithfully complied with,” he said.

40,"NEW DELHI: The coronavirus epidemic could peak in India by the middle of May and gradually peter out after that, a modelling exercise by Times Network in partnership with global consulting firm Protiviti, has predicted. The ‘Times Fact India Outbreak Report’ looks at three different possibilities and suggests that India could see the number of coronavirus cases crossing 75,000 around May 22. The team built three models to predict the progression of the coronavirus. Each model provides an estimate of how the outbreak could unfold under different conditions and provides insights on how the government and health infrastructure can respond to the crisis. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesThe report used three models: the percentage model, the time series model and the Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered (SEIR) model. The percentage model uses trends in the spread of the disease in Italy and the US, and applies them onto India to predict its trajectory. Blog: Level the field - News producers can’t keep incurring the costs while digital platforms drain away profitsCoronavirus outbreak: Complete coverageThe time series model takes into consideration data across time periods in China and South Korea, and adapts them to India’s data. The SEIR model is based on an estimation of reproduction rate of the virus, which is the average number of people each positive person infects. Together, the three models provided six projections for the outbreak and give an indication of when it might be safe to lift the lockdown.

The scenarios assume the lockdown is extended beyond May 3 and the reproduction rate of the virus is 0.8, that is, each infected person spreads the disease to 0.8 other people. In the first scenario, if the lockdown is extended to May 15, the case tally will fall to zero by September 15. In the second scenario, if the lockdown is extended to May 30, cases will drop to zero by mid-June.

41,"NEW DELHI: With states complaining that the recently acquired rapid testing kits were delivering misleading and inaccurate results, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday advised all states to stop using the antibody test for Covid-19 for two days until its teams investigated the functioning of the kits. The council said it was investigating the issue as some states had reported huge variations — ranging between 6% and 71% — in test results from rapid antibody kits which it said was unacceptable and may need to be replaced, which will be a setback to the government's plan to use rapid tests for surveillance and tracking trends, though not for diagnostics. On Tuesday morning, Rajasthan — the first state in the country to conduct rapid tests for Covid-19 — decided to stop using the kit any further as it was found that the results were inaccurate and did not correlate with the results of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. This also triggered a reaction across the country with many other states discontinuing the testing. In a tweet late on Tuesday, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said: ""I had earlier suggested to GOI (government of India) that a centralised mechanism with proper guidelines of quality check may be developed for the procurement of medical equipment. Unfortunately this was not accepted. Had this suggestion been accepted, failure of Rapid Test kits could have been avoided. We have written to ICMR for the same."" However, well-placed sources said the tests may not be at fault and might not have been correctly used. ""The kits are not faulty,"" an official familiar with the testing strategy said. ""The use of these kits for diagnosis is at fault. The proper test for Covid is the RT-PCR test. It is possible that states may have resorted to a short-cut in seeing them as diagnostic tests,"" he added. Thanks to this, India’s testing rate has dropped from 35,000-odd on Monday to 27,500 on Tuesday as states are using testing infrastructure for antibody tests. ICMR is expected to issue a detailed clarification soon. There have also been reports that the temperatures needed for the rapid tests have not been observed. More on Covid-19  Coronavirus pandemic: Complete Coverage 21-day lockdown: What will stay open and what won't How to quarantine yourself at home Trust the newspaper for your daily verified news The kits had arrived last week after several delays and have been sourced from three companies based in China. In the first batch, some 3,00,000 kits arrived close to two weeks after they were due. In all, 6,50,000 are to be delivered with more in the pipeline by way of domestic operations in collaboration with foreign firms and other orders that have been placed. The kits are being sent to states based on their requirements. There were complaints from states with the kits meant to be used in hotspots and red zones as a supplement to the polymerase tests that are much more reliable but take more time as it’s are a four-stage procedure to be conducted in labs. ""On Monday, we received a complaint from one state about less detection through rapid antibody test kits. So we asked around three states on Tuesday and found that among positive samples of RT-PCR, there is too much variation in rapid antibody tests,"" said ICMR’s head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, Dr R R Gangakhedkar. ""In some places, 6% to 71% of RT-PCR positive samples were positive,"" he added. ICMR has decided to send eight different teams for testing and validating the kits in the field over the next two days, after which it will issue a fresh advisory on the use of rapid antibody test kits. ""If problems are detected in batches, we will tell the company and can ask them to replace the batches,"" Dr Gangakhedkar said, while asking states to halt testing through the rapid antibody kit till then. While concerns about level of accuracy of rapid antibody tests were raised earlier too, ICMR and the health ministry maintained that the tests were to be used only for surveillance and monitoring of trends. ICMR has recommended only RT-PCR tests for testing individuals who are Covid-19 suspects, which it said was the gold standard. ""This is not a good thing because when such a huge variation is seen, we need to investigate further even if it is the first generation of the test,"" Dr Gangakhedkar said. He, however, said rapid antibody test was a new and first-generation test and would require time to develop further and perform better in new diseases like Covid-19. Highly placed sources in the government told TOI that ICMR had clarified (in government meetings) that rapid test kits show positive reports only after seven days — the period a body needs to generate antibodies that can be detected. They also said that purchases of these kits were made directly by ICMR. ""ICMR was directly involved in procurement of rapid test kits from both China and South Korea. The vendors were approved by the local government,"" said a source. In Rajasthan, a committee submitted its report following a study conducted on rapid tests. ""The SMS Medical College submitted its report to us and they found that those who tested positive in the PCR test have been found negative for Covid-19 in the rapid test. When we correlated the results of PCR and rapid tests, we found that only 5.4% were matching. Ideally, the matching should be at least 90%,"" said Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma. Maharashtra put a last-minute stop on using the rapid test kits. The state had received 75,000 kits and was planning to carry out tests among healthcare workers and subsequently in hotspots such as Mumbai’s Dharavi. The BMC had plans to start testing medical workers using the rapid kits from Wednesday. Dr Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner of the National Health Mission, said that they have decided to wait for 48 hours for the ICMR’s new advisory. West Bengal decided to put rapid tests on hold till it got a clearance from ICMR, Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim said late on Tuesday. Bengal had tested 78 people on Monday and another 220 on Tuesday. Punjab, which was amongst the first states to flag the issue of low accuracy, decided not to use kits provided by the central government. To check the accuracy of the kits, Punjab principal health secretary Anurag Agarwal on April 19 got a survey conducted in Mohali and Jalandhar, the worst-hit districts in the state, by testing positive cases. Random sampling among the general public was also done. In both the categories, a majority of samples collected showed false negative and positive results. In Uttar Pradesh, state surveillance officer for Covid-19 Vikasendu Agarwal said: ""UP will put on hold use of rapid kits after ICMR's observation."" UP had recently used the kits to screen over 10,500 children who returned from Kota. The kits were also used for surveillance in hotspots of Gautam Buddh Nagar. Gujarat too has put its use on hold. ""There are two confirmatory strips — IgM and IgG — in these kits. Both are to turn positive to confirm a case. But in certain cases, only one of the two strips shows results while the other strip fails and hence the case remains inconclusive,"" said principal secretary (health) Jayanthi Ravi. Tamil Nadu, which ordered four lakh rapid antibody testing kits, has put its orders on hold since Saturday. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation managing director P Umanath said his team was re-negotiating the price and re-evaluating the stock required after the ICMR said the tests cannot be used for diagnostic purposes. While Assam and Haryana too have suspended use of these kits, states like Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are yet to begin using them.

49,"NEW DELHI: With indications emerging that aviation and Metro train services may be first modes of transport to resume after lockdown, CISF has formulated post-lockdown safety measures for the two key sectors secured by it — airports and Delhi Metro. While business continuity plan for safe air travel was forwarded on April 8 to the officers in-charge of security at various airports, CISF is now finalising similar norms for Delhi Metro service, including restricting the number of entrances at each metro station to just one or two, setting up sanitising tunnels, mass thermal scanning of commuters and marking seats/spots in coaches that must remain empty to maintain social distancing. “We had earlier framed guidelines of safe air travel post-lockdown. Now CISF is also formulating SOPs for post-lockdown safety of metro sector. We are working on putting in place a system that will allow an immediate feedback on any passenger in the crowd who has high temperature. Individual reading of of commuters with a hand-held temperature gun is not ideal given the high metro traffic. The thermal scanner will send out an alarm upon detecting high temperature in a crowd, enabling rapid feedback and cutting response time,” CISF director general Rajesh Ranjan told TOI. TOI has learnt that airlines may resume operations on a limited scale after May 3 though a final call will be taken closer to that date. Seating plan in aircraft may require passengers to be seated in a Z-formation, leaving two seats in each row empty, said a source. Sanitising tunnels have been recommended by CISF for both airports and metro. CISF SOPs on preventing Covid-19 spread in metro, likely to be submitted to DMRC early next week, also look to limit entrances to each metro station to just one or maximum two. “This will make security screening easier. We will also set a protocol on businesses operating from metro stations, which will require their staff to wear masks, common surfaces to be sanitised and careful handling of cargo inflow and outflow,” said Ranjan. While DRDO model of sanitising tunnel may be adopted, CISF is still studying which chemicals can be sprayed on those passing through the tunnel without adverse health effects associated with long and frequent exposure. With running metro coaches with a lesser carrying capacity inevitable post-lockdown, spaces in between two passenger seats may be marked with a ‘cross’ to indicate that they must be left vacant. Also giving paramount importance to safety of CISF personnel deployed at airports and in metro stations, the force shall be ensuring appropriate social distancing measures. CISF is augmenting its stock of face-masks, hand gloves, alcohol based sanitisers, PPEs, so as to have sufficient numbers available for 2-3 months. An option is to use a modified version of PPE, which possibly covers full face, in high-risk areas. Quick reaction teams handling law and order situation at airports may be given PPEs. ""CISF personnel have been doing exemplary work in helping the authorities fight Covid-19 and large-heartedly offering food, masks and rations to the needy from their own stocks. Their safety and fitness is our clear priority,” said CISF DG. DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

54,"LONDON: India has dropped two places on a global press freedom index to be ranked 142nd out of 180 countries in the annual Reporters Without Borders analysis released on Tuesday. 'The World Press Freedom Index 2020' said that with no murders of journalists in India in 2019, as against six in 2018, the security situation for the country's media might seem, on the face of it, to have improved. ""However, there have been constant press freedom violations, including police violence against journalists, ambushes by political activists, and reprisals instigated by criminal groups or corrupt local officials,"" it said. It attributed the decline in index to ""pressure on the media to toe the Hindu nationalist government's line."" The ""coordinated hate campaigns"" waged on social networks against journalists who dare to speak or write about subjects that annoy Hindutva followers are ""alarming"", it said. ""The campaigns are particularly virulent when the targets are women,"" it said. Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF), or Reporters Without Borders, is a non-profit organisation that works to document and combat attacks on journalists around the world. South Asia in general features poorly on the index, with Pakistan dropping three places to 145, and Bangladesh dropping one place to 151.

The availability position is comfortable in both Jammu and Kashmir divisions,” Principal Secretary (Planning, Development & Monitoring and Information) Rohit Kansal said. “The supply of essential commodities and other goods is normal,” he told reporters here. Detailed guidelines have already been issued to facilitate essential supplies and functioning of important industries, Kansal added. “Detailed SOPs have been framed and mechanisms for permissions, passes formulated and streamlined,” he said. Kansal added that J&K was among the first in the country to be alert to the problem. “We had probably the most effective and strict protocols even at the cost of some inconvenience. We feel that a bit of convenience can always be sacrificed to achieve a larger goal. This is where we need your support,” the officials, who is also the government spokesperson, said. He expressed gratitude for the support received from all citizens. “I would request for your continued cooperation. I would also strongly urge all of you to trust the department's judgement whenever some zones are being designated as red zones,” Kansal said. He also asked the people to follow the advisories and said there was no room for complacency. “Our self-restraint and discipline must continue. We should go out only if it is must. Use of masks has been made mandatory for everyone going out. Every member of a priority or AAY household will get one free of cost mask, while others will get it at a subsidy,” Kansal said. He said religious leaders and others have been appealing to avoid all gatherings and people must heed them. Kansal said the strategy of aggressive tracing and increased testing would continue. “We will further strengthen our surveillance system and procedure. We are launching a unique app, Swasthya Nidhi COVID-19 Health Audit, for monitoring the households under surveillance on real time basis and effectively monitor the health status of the enlisted individuals,” he said. “A pilot of this project has already started in Jammu district.

White Alert is only a warning,"" the IMA said in a letter addressed to its doctors and hospitals. ""The Covid-19 has only made us acutely aware of our helplessness against mindless abuse and violence. Stigma and social boycott are everywhere.

The doctors' body also warned that they will observe 'Black Day' if no action is taken by the government and doctors in the country will work with black badges on April 23. Further decisions will be taken if suitable steps are not taken by the government even after Black Day, the IMA said. ""The IMA has maintained utmost restraint and patience in spite of extreme provocations. Doctors have been abused, beaten up, denied entry and residence.

Their opposition was due to a misconception that the contagion may spread in their neighbourhood if the body is buried there. The windscreens of the ambulance, in which the body of the 55-year-old neurosurgeon was brought to the crematorium on Sunday night, were smashed.

60,"KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: The face-off between the Centre and West Bengal over the visit of two central teams for an on-the-spot assessment of the COVID-19 situation escalated on Tuesday as the panel members lay confined to guest houses for most part of the day before the state relented following a stern letter from the Union home secretary. The arrival of the teams in Kolkata without prior intimation to the state government has set off a tussle between the ruling dispensations at the Centre and in the state, with Mamata Banerjee's TMC calling the visit adventure tourism and violation of the tenets of federal structure, and the BJP accusing her government of hiding data about the pandemic. The two teams that were to tour the affected areas and interact with health workers kept cooling their heels in guest houses in Kolkata and Jalpaiguri, before the Centre intervened, with Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla shooting off a stern letter to the states chief secretary Rajiva Sinha reminding him of provisions of law and a Supreme Court order. Apurva Chandra, the leader of one of the two teams sent to the state, claimed its members were told they ""will not be going out"" on Tuesday. Chandra, an Additional secretary in the Defence Ministry, said,""We have been deployed by the central government and our order of deployment says that the state government is to provide logistic(al) support to us... I have been in touch with the chief secretary and seeking his support since the time I landed here. ""I had also met him yesterday. But today we have been informed that there are some issues so we are not going out. The chief secretary is likely to visit us and we will again hold a meeting with him,"" he told a TV news channel in Kolkata. As tensions flared, the Union home ministry intervened, with its secretary Bhalla writing to the states chief secretary that the two inter-ministerial central teams, visiting Kolkata and Jalpaiguri, have not been extended desired cooperation by the state and local authorities. ""In fact, they have been specifically restrained from making any visits, interacting with health professionals, and assessing the ground level situation. ""This amounts to obstructing the implementation of the orders issued by the central government under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and equally binding directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,"" Bhalla said. The Union home secretary said, therefore, the state government is directed to make all necessary arrangements for the central teams to carry out such responsibilities as have been entrusted to them. After the strongly worded letter from Bhalla, the team in Kolkata was allowed to visit parts of the city escorted by BSF and state police contingents. ""The central team told us that it wants to visit parts of the city. We agreed and state government officials are accompanying the team,"" Rajiva Sinha later told reporters. When pressed further whether the team would be allowed to visit other districts and how long it plans to stay in Bengal, the top bureaucrat of the state said, ""Nothing has been decided about their visit to other districts. When they come up with it (the proposal), we would take a call. About the duration of their stay, we would like to say it clearly that we have not invited them, they have come on their own. At a time when we are fighting the disease, making arrangements for their visit is tough."" Political temperature, meanwhile, soared as the TMC dubbed as ""adventure tourism"" the visit of the central teams and asked why such delegations were not sent to states with much higher number of infections and hotspots. Addressing a digital press conference, TMC MPs Derek O'Brien and Sudip Bandyopadhyay claimed that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was informed about the inter-ministerial central teams' (IMCTs) visit three hours after their arrival in the state, which they said was unacceptable. ""The IMCT is on adventure tourism. The CM was told about the team's visit three hours after the team landed,"" said O'Brien. He also questioned why central teams did not visit states such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh that have higher numbers of coronavirus cases and many more hotspots. Why central teams are being sent to West Bengal which does not appear in the list of the top 10 states in terms of infection, the TMC leader in Rajya Sabha asked. ""The Centre has to clarify. Why the chief minister was informed after the team had arrived? In a federal structure, you have to first inform the state government. The motive behind sending such teams is not yet clear. It needs to be clarified first,"" he said. The Union home ministry had said on Monday the COVID- 19 situation was ""especially serious"" in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata and a few other places in West Bengal, and formed six IMCTs for an on-the-spot assessment and issuing necessary directions to the four states - Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal. Bandyopadhyay, the leader of the Trinamool Congress in Lok Sabha, hoped that good sense would prevail and the Centre would henceforth consult the respective state before taking such a decision. ""We have kept politics behind and want a joint fight against the pandemic. Do not take our graciousness for granted, we too can talk in the political language. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah should also leave politics behind and should not take Bengal's pledge for a united fight in tackling the pandemic for granted,"" O'Brien said. ""What the central government has done by sending central teams is nothing but an insult to the people of the state, he added. Responding to a question on ""low rate of testing"" in the state, Bandyopadhyay said that 425 tests are conducted every day in West Bengal and the number from Tuesday would go up to 600. He said sending central teams is not only against the basic tenets of federalism but also amounted to diluting the joint fight against the COVID crisis. Taking umbrage at the Centre for sending teams to assess the ""serious"" COVID-19 situation in the state, the West Bengal chief minister had shot off a letter to the prime minister on Monday, calling it a ""unilateral"" and ""undesirable"" action. The BJP, however, defended the Centre's move. ""The central government has done the right thing. They (the teams) will surely find out how the lockdown norms are being violated and how the state government is trying to hide the real picture. In order to hide the facts and figures, it is pushing the people towards a much more dangerous situation,"" state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.

62,"LONDON: India has dropped two places on a global press freedom index to be ranked 142nd out of 180 countries in the annual Reporters Without Borders analysis released on Tuesday. 'The World Press Freedom Index 2020' said that with no murders of journalists in India in 2019, as against six in 2018, the security situation for the country's media might seem, on the face of it, to have improved. ""However, there have been constant press freedom violations, including police violence against journalists, ambushes by political activists, and reprisals instigated by criminal groups or corrupt local officials,"" it said. It attributed the decline in index to ""pressure on the media to toe the Hindu nationalist government's line."" The ""coordinated hate campaigns"" waged on social networks against journalists who dare to speak or write about subjects that annoy Hindutva followers are ""alarming"", it said. ""The campaigns are particularly virulent when the targets are women,"" it said. Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF), or Reporters Without Borders, is a non-profit organisation that works to document and combat attacks on journalists around the world. South Asia in general features poorly on the index, with Pakistan dropping three places to 145, and Bangladesh dropping one place to 151. Norway is ranked first in the Index for the fourth year running. China at 177th position is just three places above North Korea, which is at 180th.

63,"JAMMU: Asserting that the supply of essential commodities and other goods is normal despite the Covid-19 lockdown, the Jammu and Kashmir administration on Tuesday sought continued cooperation of the people to combat the outbreak. “In the last 24 hours, over 1,000 trucks, including 340 trucks of fruit and vegetables and 325 trucks of rations, entered J&K. The availability position is comfortable in both Jammu and Kashmir divisions,” Principal Secretary (Planning, Development & Monitoring and Information) Rohit Kansal said. “The supply of essential commodities and other goods is normal,” he told reporters here. Detailed guidelines have already been issued to facilitate essential supplies and functioning of important industries, Kansal added. “Detailed SOPs have been framed and mechanisms for permissions, passes formulated and streamlined,” he said. Kansal added that J&K was among the first in the country to be alert to the problem. “We had probably the most effective and strict protocols even at the cost of some inconvenience. We feel that a bit of convenience can always be sacrificed to achieve a larger goal. This is where we need your support,” the officials, who is also the government spokesperson, said. He expressed gratitude for the support received from all citizens. “I would request for your continued cooperation. I would also strongly urge all of you to trust the department's judgement whenever some zones are being designated as red zones,” Kansal said. He also asked the people to follow the advisories and said there was no room for complacency. “Our self-restraint and discipline must continue. We should go out only if it is must. Use of masks has been made mandatory for everyone going out. Every member of a priority or AAY household will get one free of cost mask, while others will get it at a subsidy,” Kansal said. He said religious leaders and others have been appealing to avoid all gatherings and people must heed them. Kansal said the strategy of aggressive tracing and increased testing would continue. “We will further strengthen our surveillance system and procedure. We are launching a unique app, Swasthya Nidhi COVID-19 Health Audit, for monitoring the households under surveillance on real time basis and effectively monitor the health status of the enlisted individuals,” he said. “A pilot of this project has already started in Jammu district. We are strongly encouraging the use of Aarogya Setu App. So far, more than 6.5 lakh users have installed the app in the UT,” Kansal added. Regarding welfare measures, he said the same announced by Lt Governor G C Murmu from time to time and by the Centre under the PMGKY are being implemented. “Nearly Rs 100 crore has been released by the UT administration to the deputy commissioners and various departments. Nearly 2.20 lakh destitute, labourers and others across 1,245 camps are being supported across J&K,” Kansal said. He said nearly 10 lakh quintal of food grains, as advance rations of April and May, already stand distributed among card holders. Distribution of free rations under PMGKY as well as pulses has also started, the principal secretary said, adding that the Labour Department has transferred over Rs 15 crore to nearly 1.5 lakh registered construction workers. Listing other measures, he said, “Over 30,000 private sector employees will benefit under PMGKY scheme.” “Similarly 8.5 lakh Jan Dhan account holders have benefitted under PMGKY, while 12.5 lakh beneficiaries are getting benefit of free gas cylinder refills and Rs 183 crore pending payments to MGNREGA workers have been released by the Rural Development Department,” the official said. He added that helplines have been set up by the Resident Commissioner in Delhi, Labour Department, Divisional and Deputy Commissioners and various departments for the benefit of the people, including those stranded outside.

64,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Medical Association has demanded the Centre bring in a law on urgent basis to protect medical professionals from attack on duty, amid rising incidents of violence against healthcare workers on the frontline of the fight against Covid-19. Calling for a nation-wide 'White Alert', the IMA has asked doctors and hospitals across the country to light candles on Wednesday as a protest against such attacks. ""Light a candle with white coat. White Alert is only a warning,"" the IMA said in a letter addressed to its doctors and hospitals. ""The Covid-19 has only made us acutely aware of our helplessness against mindless abuse and violence. Stigma and social boycott are everywhere. Harassment by administration is nothing but violence by the state. ""Our legitimate needs for safe workplaces have to be met,"" it said in the letter to all State Presidents and Secretaries, Local branch Presidents and Secretaries and all National office-bearers along with past National Presidents and Past HSGs. The doctors' body also warned that they will observe 'Black Day' if no action is taken by the government and doctors in the country will work with black badges on April 23. Further decisions will be taken if suitable steps are not taken by the government even after Black Day, the IMA said. ""The IMA has maintained utmost restraint and patience in spite of extreme provocations. Doctors have been abused, beaten up, denied entry and residence. Obstruction to cremation is the last straw that IMA can bear. ""If dignity is denied even in death, our patience and restraint lose their value,” it said. “We demand a special central law against violence on doctors, nurses, health care workers and hospitals by an ordinance,"" the doctors' body said in their letter. Several incidents of violence against medical professionals have been reported from different parts of the country during the coronavirus outbreak. In a poignant incident in Chennai, an orthopaedic surgeon had to bury his associate, a neurosurgeon who died of Covid-19, in the middle of the night using his bare hands and a shovel at a crematorium with the help of just two hospital wardboys after the undertakers fled when a mob, protesting the interment, attacked them. Their opposition was due to a misconception that the contagion may spread in their neighbourhood if the body is buried there. The windscreens of the ambulance, in which the body of the 55-year-old neurosurgeon was brought to the crematorium on Sunday night, were smashed.

They will be called from the number 1921, the Health Ministry said, while cautioning against pranksters calling from any other number on the pretext of a similar survey. The survey will be conducted by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), Government of India. ""People are informed that it is a genuine survey and are requested to participate in good measure when a call comes from 1921 to enable proper feedback of the prevalence and distribution of Covid-19 symptoms.

However, a PTI tally of numbers reported by various states and union territories put the nationwide tally of positive cases at 19,867 with at least 646 deaths and 3,801 recoveries. There has been a lag in the Union health ministry figures, compared to the number of deaths announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.

""The Commission has observed that the incident is apparently indicative of negligence by the public servants. The death of three persons in such a cruel manner by the unruly mob that too during the countrywide lockdown, under extra vigil by the administration and police, amounts to gross violation of the right to life of the victims,"" a release by the NHRC on Tuesday read. According to the release, NHRC has sought a detailed report within four weeks including action taken against the culprits and relief, if any, granted to the Next of Kin (NoK) of the three deceased. According to the Commission, both the complaint and media reports mention that the victims, Sushil Giri and Kalpavriksh Giri, belonging to a sect of Sadhus, were going to attend a funeral when they along with the driver of their car were attacked by an unruly mob on suspicion that they were thieves.

68,"KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: The face-off between the Centre and West Bengal over the visit of two central teams for an on-the-spot assessment of the COVID-19 situation escalated on Tuesday as the panel members lay confined to guest houses for most part of the day before the state relented following a stern letter from the Union home secretary. The arrival of the teams in Kolkata without prior intimation to the state government has set off a tussle between the ruling dispensations at the Centre and in the state, with Mamata Banerjee's TMC calling the visit adventure tourism and violation of the tenets of federal structure, and the BJP accusing her government of hiding data about the pandemic. The two teams that were to tour the affected areas and interact with health workers kept cooling their heels in guest houses in Kolkata and Jalpaiguri, before the Centre intervened, with Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla shooting off a stern letter to the states chief secretary Rajiva Sinha reminding him of provisions of law and a Supreme Court order. Apurva Chandra, the leader of one of the two teams sent to the state, claimed its members were told they ""will not be going out"" on Tuesday. Chandra, an Additional secretary in the Defence Ministry, said,""We have been deployed by the central government and our order of deployment says that the state government is to provide logistic(al) support to us... I have been in touch with the chief secretary and seeking his support since the time I landed here. ""I had also met him yesterday. But today we have been informed that there are some issues so we are not going out. The chief secretary is likely to visit us and we will again hold a meeting with him,"" he told a TV news channel in Kolkata. As tensions flared, the Union home ministry intervened, with its secretary Bhalla writing to the states chief secretary that the two inter-ministerial central teams, visiting Kolkata and Jalpaiguri, have not been extended desired cooperation by the state and local authorities. ""In fact, they have been specifically restrained from making any visits, interacting with health professionals, and assessing the ground level situation. ""This amounts to obstructing the implementation of the orders issued by the central government under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and equally binding directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,"" Bhalla said. The Union home secretary said, therefore, the state government is directed to make all necessary arrangements for the central teams to carry out such responsibilities as have been entrusted to them. After the strongly worded letter from Bhalla, the team in Kolkata was allowed to visit parts of the city escorted by BSF and state police contingents. ""The central team told us that it wants to visit parts of the city. We agreed and state government officials are accompanying the team,"" Rajiva Sinha later told reporters. When pressed further whether the team would be allowed to visit other districts and how long it plans to stay in Bengal, the top bureaucrat of the state said, ""Nothing has been decided about their visit to other districts. When they come up with it (the proposal), we would take a call. About the duration of their stay, we would like to say it clearly that we have not invited them, they have come on their own. At a time when we are fighting the disease, making arrangements for their visit is tough."" Political temperature, meanwhile, soared as the TMC dubbed as ""adventure tourism"" the visit of the central teams and asked why such delegations were not sent to states with much higher number of infections and hotspots. Addressing a digital press conference, TMC MPs Derek O'Brien and Sudip Bandyopadhyay claimed that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was informed about the inter-ministerial central teams' (IMCTs) visit three hours after their arrival in the state, which they said was unacceptable. ""The IMCT is on adventure tourism. The CM was told about the team's visit three hours after the team landed,"" said O'Brien. He also questioned why central teams did not visit states such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh that have higher numbers of coronavirus cases and many more hotspots. Why central teams are being sent to West Bengal which does not appear in the list of the top 10 states in terms of infection, the TMC leader in Rajya Sabha asked. ""The Centre has to clarify. Why the chief minister was informed after the team had arrived? In a federal structure, you have to first inform the state government. The motive behind sending such teams is not yet clear. It needs to be clarified first,"" he said. The Union home ministry had said on Monday the COVID- 19 situation was ""especially serious"" in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata and a few other places in West Bengal, and formed six IMCTs for an on-the-spot assessment and issuing necessary directions to the four states - Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal. Bandyopadhyay, the leader of the Trinamool Congress in Lok Sabha, hoped that good sense would prevail and the Centre would henceforth consult the respective state before taking such a decision. ""We have kept politics behind and want a joint fight against the pandemic. Do not take our graciousness for granted, we too can talk in the political language. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah should also leave politics behind and should not take Bengal's pledge for a united fight in tackling the pandemic for granted,"" O'Brien said. ""What the central government has done by sending central teams is nothing but an insult to the people of the state, he added. Responding to a question on ""low rate of testing"" in the state, Bandyopadhyay said that 425 tests are conducted every day in West Bengal and the number from Tuesday would go up to 600. He said sending central teams is not only against the basic tenets of federalism but also amounted to diluting the joint fight against the COVID crisis. Taking umbrage at the Centre for sending teams to assess the ""serious"" COVID-19 situation in the state, the West Bengal chief minister had shot off a letter to the prime minister on Monday, calling it a ""unilateral"" and ""undesirable"" action. The BJP, however, defended the Centre's move. ""The central government has done the right thing. They (the teams) will surely find out how the lockdown norms are being violated and how the state government is trying to hide the real picture. In order to hide the facts and figures, it is pushing the people towards a much more dangerous situation,"" state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.

There have been 8.75 crore page views and 57 lakh content downloads in DIKSHA since March 23rd. Is the ministry thinking of advancing the summer vacation and reducing the syllabus for 2020-21 session? MHRD has presently not issued any guidelines or recommendation on early declaration of summer vacations. However, education being a concurrent subject, states can develop their own academic calendar and assessment schedule and also decide on having an early or as usual summer break depending on the locally prevalent situation. We have also formed a special taskforce under NCERT to deliberate on important issues such as academic calendar and examinations, which is likely to submit its report soon. CBSE will assess the loss of instructional time for proportionate reduction in curriculum load for board exams 2021. In accordance, course committees of the board have initiated work on reduced syllabus in various scenarios. How is MHRD harnessing tech to make assessments 100% digital? To assess possibility of conducting online exams for higher education, MHRD has constituted a taskforce under UGC. We will issue the guidelines based on their report. Is the ministry thinking of a common undergraduate admission process through NTA, given the short window likely post lockdown?NTA already conducts entrance examinations of major domains such as ICAR, IIFT, IGNOU, SWAYAM, ARPIT, JEE MAIN, NEET UG, among others. Feedback is being received for conducting common exam from various stakeholders and once opinion of all stakeholders is taken, we will be able to firm up an opinion on this. Has this unprecedented period also given India an opportunity to boost online education and improve digital infrastructure?For the first time we are creating a dedicated division for online learning in MHRD, which is going to be headed by the additional secretary. Officers will be called on deputation to work in this division who will work exclusively on online education. To address the digital divide, MHRD has tied up with I&B ministry to air SWAYAM PRABHA channels on DTH platforms. We are also trying to explore the option of AIR to transact the curriculum to students. Will the NCERT textbooks be available immediately post the lockdown?The textbooks for the session 2020-21 are printed and will be distributed as soon as schools reopens. NCERT has also prepared an alternative academic calendar for students and students can also access the e – version of the textbooks on E – Pathashala.

73,"NEW DELHI: Vehicular movement on many stretches of the national highways linking major urban centres increased by more than 60%, and in some cases nearly doubled, on Monday, compared with the daily average during the past month. After 25 days, tolling on the NHs resumed as economic activities restarted in a graded way. The traffic flow on the Gurgaon-Jaipur NH stretch increased by more than 95% on Monday, reports Dipak Dash. The three toll plazas on this stretch registered 20,000 passenger cars during the day compared with the average traffic of 10,300 during the previous days. E-way bills dip: 20L/day in Feb, but 1lakh in MarchAt Bhagan toll plaza on the Chandigarh-Delhi highway, the number of vehicles increased to 5,000 on Monday, up from 3,200 during the complete lockdown period. Data with GST network on e-way bills, however, suggested that there was only a minor rise in traffic with the number estimated at 3.3 lakh nationally on Monday, compared to a little under 3.2 lakh on Saturday. The number of e-way bills had dropped to just around one lakh when the lockdown began late last month, compared to close to 20 lakh a day in February. Trucks carrying goods that attract GST and where the value of consignment is above the prescribed value need to generate e-way bills. Toll operators told TOI that the increase in traffic flow was marginally more on stretches that are far away from major urban centres. The NHAI is compiling the data on traffic flow across toll plazas to assess the situation. “Significant increase on some stretches could be because stranded trucks have started moving,” said a toll operator.

74,"NEW DELHI: The Press Council of India (PCI) on Tuesday issued a notice to the Maharashtra government over prohibition of doorstep delivery of newspapers and magazines in the state, and sought an explanation from the chief secretary. The Maharashtra government had on Saturday decided to stop door-to-door delivery of newspapers and magazines to contain the spread of coronavirus in the state. A PCI statement said the body’s chairman, Justice Chandramouli K Prasad (retired) was concerned over the Maharashtra government’s order, especially since it did not adhere to the Union government’s March 23 directive asking all states to ensure operational continuity of print media. Doctors and epidemiologists have said newspapers are an unlikely medium for the spread of coronavirus. The government, grappling with fake news on social media platforms, has also emphasised the necessity of newspapers in disseminating reliable, fact-checked information to people. The PCI also advised state governments and administrative authorities to take necessary measures to ensure smooth functioning of media during the lockdown. “Taking suo-motu cognisance of the issue, the chairman has issued a notice for comments to the chief secretary to the government of Maharashtra,” the PCI statement said. While the Maharashtra government has said the production and sale of newspapers and magazines is allowed at stalls and shops established for the purpose, the print media has been asked to avoid home deliveries.

75,"NEW DELHI: Satellite data show that the levels of airborne particles (aerosols) over northern India dropped significantly since the Covid-19 lockdown began in the country, said the United States space agency, Nasa, on Tuesday. Aerosols are tiny solid and liquid particles, suspended in air, that reduce visibility and can damage human lungs and heart. The Nasa satellite sensors observed “aerosol levels at a 20-year low for this time of year in northern India” after just a week of reduced human activities such as closure of many factories and severely reduced vehicular and airplane traffic — a situation which allowed some in Punjab to report seeing a few Himalayan mountain ranges with the naked eye for the first time in many years. The space agency, however, noted that the story in southern India is a little hazier as satellite data show that the aerosol levels have not yet decreased to the same extent and the levels, in fact, seem to be slightly higher than in the past four years. It said though the reasons are unclear, it could be related to recent weather patterns, wind or other factors. “By all accounts, the 2020 lockdown reduced those human-made emission sources,” said a Nasa Earth Observatory report that analysed the data, retrieved by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Nasa’s Terra satellite. “We knew we would see changes in atmospheric composition in many places during the lockdown. But I have never seen aerosol values so low in the Indo-Gangetic Plain at this time of year,” said Pawan Gupta, a Universities Space Research Association (USRA) scientist at Nasa’s Marshall Space Flight Center. Though some aerosols have natural sources (dust storms, volcanic eruptions, and forest fires), the others come from human activities, such as burning of fossil fuels and agriculture fields. The Nasa Earth Observatory’s report on its portal by its science write Kasha Patel noted that the human-made aerosols “tend to contribute most of the smaller particles that have greater potential for damaging human health”. The report said such aerosols contribute to unhealthy levels of air pollution in many Indian cities. Scientists, however, expect the aerosol levels to increase slightly in upcoming weeks in parts of India as seasonal dust storms begin from the Thar Desert and Arabian Peninsula. “The hard part with understanding aerosols is that particles can move based on wind patterns and other meteorology. You have to disentangle what is caused by the human fingerprint versus a meteorological factor,” said Robert Levy, programme leader for Nasa’s MODIS aerosol products. On the lockdown and its effects on pollution, Levy said, “We have a unique opportunity to learn how the atmosphere reacts to sharp and sudden reductions in emissions from certain sectors. This can help us separate how natural and human sources of aerosols affect the atmosphere.” Earlier, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) - India’s national pollution watchdog - too in its report on ‘impact of Janta curfew and lockdown on air quality’ on March 31 noted substantial improvement in air quality in many towns and cities across the country. It attributed this improvement to stringent travel restrictions and shutting down of non-essential activities including those of air polluting sectors. The Board had analysed the real time air quality data of 115 cities from March 16 to March 29 to assess impact of lockdown.

76,"NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Tuesday said social sector services excluded from the lockdown covered bedside attendants and caregivers of senior citizens residing in their homes. The exemption for public utilities extends to prepaid mobile recharge, it was further clarified. In a clarification on the consolidated guidelines issued by the home ministry on April 15, the Home Secretary told the states/UTs that public utilities exempted from the lockdown measures included recharge facilities for pre-paid mobile connections. In addition, bedside attendants and caregivers of senior citizens could work during the lockdown subject to social distancing and other norms as prescribed in the National Covid-19 Directives and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Essential goods exempted from lockdown measures would include food processing units such as bread factories, milk processing plants, flour mills, dal mills etc. located in urban areas, it has been clarified. “However, as specified in the lockdown measures, National Covid-19 Directives and SOPs for social distancing for offices, workshops, factories and establishments must be ensured,” stated the home secretary. The fresh clarification on the guidelines comes in the wake of queries received with regard to exemptions of specific services/activities within the categories already allowed in the guidelines. The home ministry has asked district authorities and field agencies to be informed about the aforesaid clarification to avoid ambiguity at the ground level.

77,"NEW DELHI: Bureaucrats came in for praise on Tuesday for their key role in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking the lead in lauding them for working round-the-clock to ensure that everyone is healthy. In his message to bureaucrats on Civil Services Day, the Prime Minister stated: “I convey greetings to all civil servants and their families. I appreciate their efforts in ensuring India successfully defeats COVID-19. They are working round the clock, assisting those in need and ensuring everyone is healthy”. He also paid tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, “who envisioned our administrative framework and emphasised on building a system that is progress-oriented and compassionate”. Union minister of state for personnel Jitendra Singh too commended the “yeomen services“ rendered by civil servants in India’s fight against COVID-19. In a nationwide interactive video calling with 25 states and 5 Union territories to mark the Civil Services Day, he called for greater inter-service camaraderie and cited the successful example of the CARUNA platform which brings together 29 service associations in an endeavour to support natural disasters. Singh complemented the civil servants for offering one day’s salary to the Prime Minister’s CARES Fund. He particularly praised the district collectors for leading the fight against the COVID 19 pandemic on the ground, adding that India’s prospects to contain the pandemic rested “on the broad shoulders of civil servants”. The Civil Services Day events to be held on April 21, 2020, were deferred due to announcement of national lockdown. The Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration 2019 and 2020 will now be presented on October 31, 2020 to mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhai Patel.

78,"KOLKATA: The inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) deployed to Kolkata for assessing the situation related to Covid-19 management and the ongoing lockdown began their field visits late in the afternoon on Tuesday after remaining put at a Border Security Force (BSF) facility since morning. The team drove through various parts of the city, including Lake Gardens, Jadavpur, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge and Gariahat, after leaving their place of stay at about 5pm, around an hour after a strongly-worded letter from the Centre directing the state to provide all facilities to the IMCT. The team leader, Apurva Chandra, earlier complained that despite giving assurances that they would be taken around, the state government informed them that ""there are some issues, and we will not be going out."" But some time after Chandra came up with his comment, the state government provided the team with Kolkata Police escort vehicles manned by anti-rowdy section officers of the detective department and a liaison officer early in the evening. At around the same time, the Union home ministry told the media in Delhi that the state government was not cooperating with the IMCT delegation. ""The home ministry has received a feedback that the teams which have been deputed to Jalpaiguri and Kolkata in West Bengal, are not getting cooperation from the state government and the local administration. ""They are being stopped from visiting the region, they are not being given the scope to interact with health workers, or assess the ground level situation. This is a violation of the Central government order issued under the National Disaster Management Act,"" a home ministry spokesperson said. The home ministry also wrote to the state chief secretary directing the Bengal government to abide by the Centre's order in this regard, and make all necessary arrangements so that the IMCT can carry out its responsibilities effectively. The team, which landed here on Monday morning, held two rounds of meetings with state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha. While the first interaction took place on Monday at the state secretariat Nabanna, the second one happened at the BSF facility on Tuesday. The team, which has put up at the BSF Officers' Institute on Gurusaday Dutta Road in south Kolkata's Ballygunge area, went out briefly in the morning but returned to their base after traversing only 500 metre. Two Kolkata Police officers soon reached the institute and sought to know the team's programme for the day. The police then set up a post for checking on both ends of Gurusaday Dutta Road, and controlled vehicular movements. The centre's decision to send the team has triggered a big row, with the Trinamool Congress government of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee questioning the need for such a delegation. Banerjee shot off a letter to Prime Minister Nareandra Modi on Monday, describing the Centre's decision as ""unilateral', and alleging it was sent without prior intimation, causing 'breach of established protocol'. She also dubbed the Union government's selection of districts with 'serious' Covid-19 situation as a 'figment of imagination'. The home ministry in a communication on Monday claimed violation of lockdown measures were reported from some districts in the country posing a serious health hazard and risk for spread of Covid-19. Regarding West Bengal, it said: ""The situation is especially serious in Kolkata, Howrah, Medinipur East, North 24 Parganas, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpaiguri districts"". Adopting a tough stand, the state government had threatened not to allow the IMCT to move around in the state unless it had a clear idea about their needs or why they wanted to go for field visits.

79,"NEW DELHI: The Congress Tuesday attacked the government for approving the use of surplus rice to produce sanitizer, with Rahul Gandhi alleging that while the poor are “dying of hunger” their portion of rice is being used to clean the hands of the rich. ""After all, when will India's poor wake up? You are dying of hunger and they are busy cleaning the hands of the rich by making sanitizers from your portion of rice,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi. He attached a news report about the government's decision to allow the use of surplus rice for manufacturing sanitizers, which are in huge demand owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera also said the country was going through a very painful time, and while many people face food scarcity, rice is being given out for making sanitizers. He said there were several reports that migrant labourers walking miles and miles for days to reach their homes struggled for food, even though Food Corporation of India godowns are full. He said the surplus food grain reserves should have been used to expand the food safety net. “There has been a demand from various quarters to universalise the PDS…. let's assume for a minute that even if we have to feed 80 percent of our population for the next 6 months under universalised PDS, giving them 10 kg of food grains per month, do you know we are capable of doing that for the next 6 months,"" he said. Congress president Sonia Gandhi has also requested the government to ensure that people, who do not qualify for the Right to Food Act, are given food grains free of cost, he said. ""In a scenario like this, if you come and announce that okay, rice, extra rice, surplus rice will be used to make sanitizers, it is a cruel joke,” he said. Khera urged the government to ask the distilleries to use their infrastructure to make sanitizer. Instead of announcing that 10 kg food grains will be given to all families whether or not they are under the PDS, the government announced that surplus rice will be used to make sanitizers, he said. “This is shocking beyond belief.” The Congress has been highlighting the problem of the poor and vulnerable sections in society since the lockdown was imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus in the country. The opposition party has been urging the government to grant free ration to all of them as well as provide Rs 7,500 in the bank accounts of every person to help them tide over the crisis due to the coronavirus-forced lockdown. The government on Monday approved that surplus rice available with Food Corporation of India (FCI) can be converted into ethanol in order to manufacture alcohol-based hand sanitizers and also for blending with petrol. The decision was taken at a meeting of the National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC). Meanwhile, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan asserted that there is no shortage of food grains in the country for the poor and asked Rahul Gandhi to shun his ""negative mindset”. Paswan hit back at Rahul Gadhi and questioned if he does not want the economically weaker sections to use sanitizers and masks.

80,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra government's priority is to break the chain of COVID-19 pandemic as soon as possible and lift the lockdown to get the state economy back on track, state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said on Tuesday. Maharashtra is the most-affected state in the country with the number of COVID-19 positive cases crossing 4,000 mark and death toll rising to over 200. Even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown in the country on March 25, Maharashtra had announced a lockdown from March 23, while all construction activities had come to a standstill since March 21. ""We are currently in the middle of the biggest crisis that world might have ever seen. While we, as a government, are sensitive towards the economic pain that various sectors are going through, the priority for us is to break this chain of coronavirus pandemic,"" Thackeray said during an online seminar organised by real estate apex body Naredco. He said the intent of the government is to completely lift the lockdown as soon as possible but not before it is able to break the pandemic chain. ""In my interactions with various stakeholders, I am asked two questions- when will the lockdown go and how long is it (lockdown) sustainable. The only answer to these questions is- as long as we, as a country, are successful in controlling the spread. We too are not happy to impose it but our success lies in breaking the chain. It is important to save lives first,"" Thackeray said. He said the state along with local bodies have conducted over 75,800 tests so far and only 6 per cent have tested positive. Noting that the real estate sector has been under pressure since the past few years, he said the government was committed to assisting the sector. ""Maharashtra has the largest number of industries with the largest manufacturing and services base and a vibrant housing industry. Due to demonetisation or haphazard implementation of the GST, the real estate sector has been feeling the pain, but with the new government under chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, we are working towards coming up with some solutions. I am not promising a concrete solution at this moment but we have already set up a task force which is working towards it,"" he added. Developers' associations have been demanding a one time stimulus package for the sector along with reduction in GST as well as stamp duty.

82,"Even before President Donald Trump announced that he intends to temporarily suspend immigration to the US because of Covid-19, it was becoming clear that the effect of the virus on migration would be powerful, long-lasting and unfortunate. Many countries besides the US have already shuttered or severely limited entry from foreigners — and many of those restrictions will not be so easily removed when the worst of the pandemic has passed. First, there is no guarantee that a good vaccine will be ready quickly, even within two years. There is still no vaccine, for instance, for the common cold or HIV-AIDS. Even if the US has Covid-19 under control, there might be persistent if small pockets of Covid-19 in other countries, including populous, poor countries such as India, Pakistan and Nigeria. The US may be reluctant to take new migrants from those parts of the world. Whether or not that reaction is rational, it is easy to imagine the public being fearful about the potential of immigration to contribute to a pandemic resurgence. It does seem that regions able to restrict in-migration relatively easily — such as New Zealand, Iceland and Hawaii — have had less severe Covid-19 problems. New York City, which takes in people from around the world, has had America’s most severe outbreak. And the recent appearance of a second wave of Covid-19 in Singapore has been connected to ongoing migration there. I have never thought the federal government would build Trump’s wall on the US-Mexico border. But now I wonder whether it may well happen — perhaps in electronic form. There is another side to this issue, of course: Many countries may decide to continue to limit visitors from the US The American government might then respond by restricting in-migration from those countries. This kind of tit-for-tat retaliation is not always rational, but it is a pretty common phenomenon in international relations. Alternatively, maybe many poorer (and richer?) countries will acquire “herd immunity” even without good access to a vaccine. But that will be hard to prove, and the casualties that mount along the way may scare the US public away from allowing more immigration from those countries, even if their citizens end up as safer bets than Americans. In recent times China had been the largest source of immigrants to the US These days it is difficult to imagine a member of the US Congress taking to the floor and demanding that America open its shores to the Chinese once again, no matter what the actual level of safety. In addition to these effects, many migrants currently living in the US might go back home. Say you are from southern India and live in Atlanta, and typically your parents or grandparents come to visit once a year. That is now much harder for them to do, and will be for the foreseeable future. India also might make it more difficult for Indian-Americans to return to visit their relatives, perhaps demanding an immunity certificate for entry. Many of these current migrants will end up returning home to live in their native countries. Even if a vaccine comes along in a few years, restrictions on immigrants will have become the legal status quo — and in a democracy with a lot of checks and balances, status-quo bias can be very strong. Those restrictions are not likely to be reversed very quickly. In spite of all those possible restrictions, the pandemic itself may offer new reasons to embrace some forms of migration, if only to help Western economies continue to function. Many jobs are now more dangerous than before, because they involve face-to-face contact and time spent in enclosed spaces. Such professions as nursing and dental assistants, for example, already attracted many immigrants even before Covid-19. Working on farms may yet become more perilous if the virus strikes farm worker communities. New migrants from poorer countries will be willing to take on these risks — for extra income of course — but most US citizens won’t go near them. The reality may be an uptick in some forms of migration, mostly for relatively hazardous jobs. There could be a national guest-worker program, managed by quota by profession, to ensure that such jobs are filled. It is a little-known fact that last month the US government eased H-2 visa rules, in part to make it easier for Mexican farm workers to enter this country and work to secure the food supply chain. And this was from an administration not favorable to greater immigration. So yes, immigration is likely to remain at depressed levels for years to come. At the same time, businesses will probably continue to furtively appeal for foreign workers for dangerous sectors, hire them and then keep many of them at arm’s length from mainstream American society. That, at least as much as any reduction in overall levels, could be what the next wave of immigration looks like.

83,"CHANDIGARH: Pointing to the alarming gap between the state’s anticipated receipt and committed expenditure, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday demanded from Centre an interim compensation to the tune of Rs 3000 crore for the month of April on account of the COVID-19 national disaster.  In a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, Amarinder also asked for expediting the release of the state’s GST arrears of Rs 4400 crore for the last four months, to help the state overcome its resource constraint.  Citing the lockdown that had substantial fiscal consequences for all states, Amarinder said the Centre should compensate Punjab for its loss of revenue due to COVID-19. While the Rs 3000 crore for April was an estimate, he said “detailed assessment of loss and requirement of funds for relief and rehabilitation will be submitted in due course.” However, he stressed, “the Government of India should provide interim assistance so that the fight against COVID-19 is not allowed to weaken in any way.” He added that Punjab was facing a huge stress on state exchequer on account of the required health and relief measures that are being continuously scaled up, “with hardly any revenue receipts accruing to the state during these days due to near complete shutdown of trade, business and industry.” Amarinder observed that receipts expected for April were expected to decline sharply as most economic activities in the state remain closed on account of the lockdown. The receipts on account of SGST, IGST, and VAT, excise, stamp duty and motor vehicle taxes are almost negligible and the reduced electricity consumption has resulted in a drop of 60% of the expected revenue from electricity duty during April 2020, he noted.  In addition, said Amarinder, the GST compensation of approximately Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months - from December, 2019 to March, 2020 - was also pending for disbursement by the Union Government.  On the other hand, he pointed out, the committed expenditure - debt servicing, pensions, salaries, relief measures for COVID-19, health care and infrastructure etc., is budgeted at Rs 7,301 crore for the month of April 2020. Pointing to the critical fiscal situation of the state, Amarinder also sought the Centre’s permission to allow sale of liquor, in a phased manner, to mop up VAT and excise revenue. The Ministry of Home, GoI, should “allow the state to take a conscious decision to allow the sale of liquor in certain areas in a phased manner with strict social distancing and other measures to prevent COVID-19,” he said. This, said Amarinder, would help the state immensely in its efforts to scale up the relief and health care measures to combat COVID-19 and meet some, if not all, of its committed liabilities and other day-to-day expenses.

84,"NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Tuesday said social sector services excluded from the lockdown covered bedside attendants and caregivers of senior citizens residing in their homes. The exemption for public utilities extends to prepaid mobile recharge, it was further clarified. In a clarification on the consolidated guidelines issued by the home ministry on April 15, the Home Secretary told the states/UTs that public utilities exempted from the lockdown measures included recharge facilities for pre-paid mobile connections. In addition, bedside attendants and caregivers of senior citizens could work during the lockdown subject to social distancing and other norms as prescribed in the National Covid-19 Directives and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Essential goods exempted from lockdown measures would include food processing units such as bread factories, milk processing plants, flour mills, dal mills etc. located in urban areas, it has been clarified. “However, as specified in the lockdown measures, National Covid-19 Directives and SOPs for social distancing for offices, workshops, factories and establishments must be ensured,” stated the home secretary. The fresh clarification on the guidelines comes in the wake of queries received with regard to exemptions of specific services/activities within the categories already allowed in the guidelines. The home ministry has asked district authorities and field agencies to be informed about the aforesaid clarification to avoid ambiguity at the ground level.

85,"NEW DELHI: Bureaucrats came in for praise on Tuesday for their key role in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking the lead in lauding them for working round-the-clock to ensure that everyone is healthy. In his message to bureaucrats on Civil Services Day, the Prime Minister stated: “I convey greetings to all civil servants and their families. I appreciate their efforts in ensuring India successfully defeats COVID-19. They are working round the clock, assisting those in need and ensuring everyone is healthy”. He also paid tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, “who envisioned our administrative framework and emphasised on building a system that is progress-oriented and compassionate”. Union minister of state for personnel Jitendra Singh too commended the “yeomen services“ rendered by civil servants in India’s fight against COVID-19. In a nationwide interactive video calling with 25 states and 5 Union territories to mark the Civil Services Day, he called for greater inter-service camaraderie and cited the successful example of the CARUNA platform which brings together 29 service associations in an endeavour to support natural disasters. Singh complemented the civil servants for offering one day’s salary to the Prime Minister’s CARES Fund. He particularly praised the district collectors for leading the fight against the COVID 19 pandemic on the ground, adding that India’s prospects to contain the pandemic rested “on the broad shoulders of civil servants”. The Civil Services Day events to be held on April 21, 2020, were deferred due to announcement of national lockdown. The Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration 2019 and 2020 will now be presented on October 31, 2020 to mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhai Patel.

86,"KOLKATA: The inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) deployed to Kolkata for assessing the situation related to Covid-19 management and the ongoing lockdown began their field visits late in the afternoon on Tuesday after remaining put at a Border Security Force (BSF) facility since morning. The team drove through various parts of the city, including Lake Gardens, Jadavpur, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge and Gariahat, after leaving their place of stay at about 5pm, around an hour after a strongly-worded letter from the Centre directing the state to provide all facilities to the IMCT. The team leader, Apurva Chandra, earlier complained that despite giving assurances that they would be taken around, the state government informed them that ""there are some issues, and we will not be going out."" But some time after Chandra came up with his comment, the state government provided the team with Kolkata Police escort vehicles manned by anti-rowdy section officers of the detective department and a liaison officer early in the evening. At around the same time, the Union home ministry told the media in Delhi that the state government was not cooperating with the IMCT delegation. ""The home ministry has received a feedback that the teams which have been deputed to Jalpaiguri and Kolkata in West Bengal, are not getting cooperation from the state government and the local administration. ""They are being stopped from visiting the region, they are not being given the scope to interact with health workers, or assess the ground level situation. This is a violation of the Central government order issued under the National Disaster Management Act,"" a home ministry spokesperson said. The home ministry also wrote to the state chief secretary directing the Bengal government to abide by the Centre's order in this regard, and make all necessary arrangements so that the IMCT can carry out its responsibilities effectively. The team, which landed here on Monday morning, held two rounds of meetings with state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha. While the first interaction took place on Monday at the state secretariat Nabanna, the second one happened at the BSF facility on Tuesday. The team, which has put up at the BSF Officers' Institute on Gurusaday Dutta Road in south Kolkata's Ballygunge area, went out briefly in the morning but returned to their base after traversing only 500 metre. Two Kolkata Police officers soon reached the institute and sought to know the team's programme for the day. The police then set up a post for checking on both ends of Gurusaday Dutta Road, and controlled vehicular movements. The centre's decision to send the team has triggered a big row, with the Trinamool Congress government of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee questioning the need for such a delegation. Banerjee shot off a letter to Prime Minister Nareandra Modi on Monday, describing the Centre's decision as ""unilateral', and alleging it was sent without prior intimation, causing 'breach of established protocol'. She also dubbed the Union government's selection of districts with 'serious' Covid-19 situation as a 'figment of imagination'. The home ministry in a communication on Monday claimed violation of lockdown measures were reported from some districts in the country posing a serious health hazard and risk for spread of Covid-19. Regarding West Bengal, it said: ""The situation is especially serious in Kolkata, Howrah, Medinipur East, North 24 Parganas, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpaiguri districts"". Adopting a tough stand, the state government had threatened not to allow the IMCT to move around in the state unless it had a clear idea about their needs or why they wanted to go for field visits.

87,"NEW DELHI: The Congress Tuesday attacked the government for approving the use of surplus rice to produce sanitizer, with Rahul Gandhi alleging that while the poor are “dying of hunger” their portion of rice is being used to clean the hands of the rich. ""After all, when will India's poor wake up? You are dying of hunger and they are busy cleaning the hands of the rich by making sanitizers from your portion of rice,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi. He attached a news report about the government's decision to allow the use of surplus rice for manufacturing sanitizers, which are in huge demand owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera also said the country was going through a very painful time, and while many people face food scarcity, rice is being given out for making sanitizers. He said there were several reports that migrant labourers walking miles and miles for days to reach their homes struggled for food, even though Food Corporation of India godowns are full. He said the surplus food grain reserves should have been used to expand the food safety net. “There has been a demand from various quarters to universalise the PDS…. let's assume for a minute that even if we have to feed 80 percent of our population for the next 6 months under universalised PDS, giving them 10 kg of food grains per month, do you know we are capable of doing that for the next 6 months,"" he said. Congress president Sonia Gandhi has also requested the government to ensure that people, who do not qualify for the Right to Food Act, are given food grains free of cost, he said. ""In a scenario like this, if you come and announce that okay, rice, extra rice, surplus rice will be used to make sanitizers, it is a cruel joke,” he said. Khera urged the government to ask the distilleries to use their infrastructure to make sanitizer. Instead of announcing that 10 kg food grains will be given to all families whether or not they are under the PDS, the government announced that surplus rice will be used to make sanitizers, he said. “This is shocking beyond belief.” The Congress has been highlighting the problem of the poor and vulnerable sections in society since the lockdown was imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus in the country. The opposition party has been urging the government to grant free ration to all of them as well as provide Rs 7,500 in the bank accounts of every person to help them tide over the crisis due to the coronavirus-forced lockdown. The government on Monday approved that surplus rice available with Food Corporation of India (FCI) can be converted into ethanol in order to manufacture alcohol-based hand sanitizers and also for blending with petrol. The decision was taken at a meeting of the National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC). Meanwhile, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan asserted that there is no shortage of food grains in the country for the poor and asked Rahul Gandhi to shun his ""negative mindset”. Paswan hit back at Rahul Gadhi and questioned if he does not want the economically weaker sections to use sanitizers and masks.

88,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra government's priority is to break the chain of COVID-19 pandemic as soon as possible and lift the lockdown to get the state economy back on track, state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said on Tuesday. Maharashtra is the most-affected state in the country with the number of COVID-19 positive cases crossing 4,000 mark and death toll rising to over 200. Even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown in the country on March 25, Maharashtra had announced a lockdown from March 23, while all construction activities had come to a standstill since March 21. ""We are currently in the middle of the biggest crisis that world might have ever seen. While we, as a government, are sensitive towards the economic pain that various sectors are going through, the priority for us is to break this chain of coronavirus pandemic,"" Thackeray said during an online seminar organised by real estate apex body Naredco. He said the intent of the government is to completely lift the lockdown as soon as possible but not before it is able to break the pandemic chain. ""In my interactions with various stakeholders, I am asked two questions- when will the lockdown go and how long is it (lockdown) sustainable. The only answer to these questions is- as long as we, as a country, are successful in controlling the spread. We too are not happy to impose it but our success lies in breaking the chain. It is important to save lives first,"" Thackeray said. He said the state along with local bodies have conducted over 75,800 tests so far and only 6 per cent have tested positive. Noting that the real estate sector has been under pressure since the past few years, he said the government was committed to assisting the sector. ""Maharashtra has the largest number of industries with the largest manufacturing and services base and a vibrant housing industry. Due to demonetisation or haphazard implementation of the GST, the real estate sector has been feeling the pain, but with the new government under chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, we are working towards coming up with some solutions. I am not promising a concrete solution at this moment but we have already set up a task force which is working towards it,"" he added. Developers' associations have been demanding a one time stimulus package for the sector along with reduction in GST as well as stamp duty.

89,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Tuesday dismissed a plea seeking direction to the Centre, all states and Union territories to provide free of cost treatment for coronavirus infection till Covid-19 pandemic is contained, saying it is for the government to take a call on it. Meanwhile, India's count of positive coronavirus cases reached 18,985 after 1,329 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours while the death toll has climbed to 603, the Union ministry of health said.  Here are the top developments 1 India   Amid complaints about faulty rapid test kits, the Indian Council of Medical Research on Tuesday advised states not to use them for the next two days, saying it will issue an advisory after their teams carry out field validation of these equipment. Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday extended greetings on Civil Services Day, saying like health professionals, the civil servants have also been leading the fight against coronavirus.  A total of 3,252 people have been cured of coronavirus in India so far, including 705 patients who were discharged on Monday, taking the recovery percentage to 17.48 per cent, the government said. A political standoff emerged between the state and the Centre after Union home ministry said the state government was not cooperating with the central teams visiting there to assess the Covid-19 situation. The TMC said the visit of central teams to West Bengal was like ""adventure tourism"". Having made face masks out of fabric meant for employees' uniforms, the Northern Railways has bagged its first order of 2,000 masks that are washable, cheap and even available in orange, the colour worn by trackmen on duty. In view of the lockdown to combat coronavirus, the government has decided to continue the facility of interest subvention of 2 per cent and prompt repayment incentive of 3 per cent to farmers till May 31, 2020, the RBI said . Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that control rooms should be set up in assemblies for better coordination between states in helping migrant labourers and students stranded due to the ongoing lockdown to combat the novel coronavirus.

90,"Even before President Donald Trump announced that he intends to temporarily suspend immigration to the US because of Covid-19, it was becoming clear that the effect of the virus on migration would be powerful, long-lasting and unfortunate. Many countries besides the US have already shuttered or severely limited entry from foreigners — and many of those restrictions will not be so easily removed when the worst of the pandemic has passed. First, there is no guarantee that a good vaccine will be ready quickly, even within two years. There is still no vaccine, for instance, for the common cold or HIV-AIDS. Even if the US has Covid-19 under control, there might be persistent if small pockets of Covid-19 in other countries, including populous, poor countries such as India, Pakistan and Nigeria. The US may be reluctant to take new migrants from those parts of the world. Whether or not that reaction is rational, it is easy to imagine the public being fearful about the potential of immigration to contribute to a pandemic resurgence. It does seem that regions able to restrict in-migration relatively easily — such as New Zealand, Iceland and Hawaii — have had less severe Covid-19 problems. New York City, which takes in people from around the world, has had America’s most severe outbreak. And the recent appearance of a second wave of Covid-19 in Singapore has been connected to ongoing migration there. I have never thought the federal government would build Trump’s wall on the US-Mexico border. But now I wonder whether it may well happen — perhaps in electronic form. There is another side to this issue, of course: Many countries may decide to continue to limit visitors from the US The American government might then respond by restricting in-migration from those countries. This kind of tit-for-tat retaliation is not always rational, but it is a pretty common phenomenon in international relations. Alternatively, maybe many poorer (and richer?) countries will acquire “herd immunity” even without good access to a vaccine. But that will be hard to prove, and the casualties that mount along the way may scare the US public away from allowing more immigration from those countries, even if their citizens end up as safer bets than Americans. In recent times China had been the largest source of immigrants to the US These days it is difficult to imagine a member of the US Congress taking to the floor and demanding that America open its shores to the Chinese once again, no matter what the actual level of safety. In addition to these effects, many migrants currently living in the US might go back home. Say you are from southern India and live in Atlanta, and typically your parents or grandparents come to visit once a year. That is now much harder for them to do, and will be for the foreseeable future. India also might make it more difficult for Indian-Americans to return to visit their relatives, perhaps demanding an immunity certificate for entry. Many of these current migrants will end up returning home to live in their native countries. Even if a vaccine comes along in a few years, restrictions on immigrants will have become the legal status quo — and in a democracy with a lot of checks and balances, status-quo bias can be very strong. Those restrictions are not likely to be reversed very quickly. In spite of all those possible restrictions, the pandemic itself may offer new reasons to embrace some forms of migration, if only to help Western economies continue to function. Many jobs are now more dangerous than before, because they involve face-to-face contact and time spent in enclosed spaces. Such professions as nursing and dental assistants, for example, already attracted many immigrants even before Covid-19. Working on farms may yet become more perilous if the virus strikes farm worker communities. New migrants from poorer countries will be willing to take on these risks — for extra income of course — but most US citizens won’t go near them. The reality may be an uptick in some forms of migration, mostly for relatively hazardous jobs. There could be a national guest-worker program, managed by quota by profession, to ensure that such jobs are filled. It is a little-known fact that last month the US government eased H-2 visa rules, in part to make it easier for Mexican farm workers to enter this country and work to secure the food supply chain. And this was from an administration not favorable to greater immigration. So yes, immigration is likely to remain at depressed levels for years to come. At the same time, businesses will probably continue to furtively appeal for foreign workers for dangerous sectors, hire them and then keep many of them at arm’s length from mainstream American society. That, at least as much as any reduction in overall levels, could be what the next wave of immigration looks like.

91,"CHANDIGARH: Pointing to the alarming gap between the state’s anticipated receipt and committed expenditure, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday demanded from Centre an interim compensation to the tune of Rs 3000 crore for the month of April on account of the COVID-19 national disaster.  In a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, Amarinder also asked for expediting the release of the state’s GST arrears of Rs 4400 crore for the last four months, to help the state overcome its resource constraint.  Citing the lockdown that had substantial fiscal consequences for all states, Amarinder said the Centre should compensate Punjab for its loss of revenue due to COVID-19. While the Rs 3000 crore for April was an estimate, he said “detailed assessment of loss and requirement of funds for relief and rehabilitation will be submitted in due course.” However, he stressed, “the Government of India should provide interim assistance so that the fight against COVID-19 is not allowed to weaken in any way.” He added that Punjab was facing a huge stress on state exchequer on account of the required health and relief measures that are being continuously scaled up, “with hardly any revenue receipts accruing to the state during these days due to near complete shutdown of trade, business and industry.” Amarinder observed that receipts expected for April were expected to decline sharply as most economic activities in the state remain closed on account of the lockdown. The receipts on account of SGST, IGST, and VAT, excise, stamp duty and motor vehicle taxes are almost negligible and the reduced electricity consumption has resulted in a drop of 60% of the expected revenue from electricity duty during April 2020, he noted.  In addition, said Amarinder, the GST compensation of approximately Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months - from December, 2019 to March, 2020 - was also pending for disbursement by the Union Government.

92,"BHOPAL: Nearly a month after CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan took oath of office, Madhya Pradesh got a ‘covid-cabinet’, but still no health or home minister. The 'mini-cabinet' has just five ministers – none with a portfolio. Two of them are from the Jyotiraditya Scindia group. The chosen ones are Narottam Mishra, Kamal Patel, Meena Singh, Tulsi Silawat and Govind Singh Rajput. Silawat and Rajput are Scindia loyalists and were ministers in the Kamal Nath cabinet. They played key roles in the breakaway from Congress, which led to the collapse of the Nath government in March. No portfolios have been allocated yet, but the ministers have been put in charge of two divisions each to manage the fightback against Covid-19. For nearly a month after being sworn in as CM, Chouhan ran a one-man show without a council of ministers, triggering criticism from the opposition. The buzz is that a tug of war between factions in BJP -- including Scindia's -- for plum portfolios was delaying formation of the cabinet. On Tuesday, when Governor Lalji Tandon administered oath of office to the five ministers at Raj Bhavan, there was anticipation that key portfolios would be allocated, but that wasn't to be. Chouhan said: “The cabinet is small but balanced, and effort has been made to give representation to all sections of society. Whatever is left will be taken care of in the next expansion after the lockdown is lifted.” Silawat has been put in charge of Indore – MP’s corona hotspot -- and Sagar divisions. Mishra has been given charge of Bhopal and Ujjain – the other two red zones of MP. Patel will handle Jabalpur and Narmadapuram divisions, Rajput gets Chambal and Gwalior and Meena Singh will look after Rewa and Shahdol divisions. Mishra and Silawat have been health ministers. The CM said the ministers would keep watch on the situation in the districts under their charge and, in consultation with local public representatives, officials and public at large, would formulate strategies to overcome the menace. Former CM Kamal Nath criticized the mini-cabinet, saying it was a “mockery of the people of Madhya Pradesh”. “During this time of Corona pandemic, BJP has made fun of the 7.5 crore people of the state. A cabinet has been formed after a month, that too with only five ministers and no allocation of department,” he tweeted. In a second tweet, Nath took a dig at BJP, and said: “It’s clear how much internal conflict is on in BJP. How many days will this government run? Let’s wait and watch.” Many top state BJP leaders have been left out, including former LOP Gopal Bhargava and several powerful ministers in the previous Shivraj cabinet -- Bhupendra Singh, Yashodhara Raje Scindia, Sanjay Pathak, Rajendra Shukla, Vijay Shah, Surendra Patwa, Rampal Singh and Paras Jain. Political observers feel the covid-cabinet was more of a “ritual” to silence Congress, coming as it did just a day after Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha petitioned the President not to approve two financial ordinances promulgated by the Shivraj government since there was no cabinet in MP. What stands out in the mini cabinet is that all sections have been represented -- Brahmin, Thakur, OBC, Dalit and tribal. And, except for Mahakaushal, so have all regions of MP.

94,"NEW DELHI: The lockdown due to the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak has severely hampered the supply of anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs to the central government’s National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP), prompting the health ministry to recommend a ban on export of these drugs. Leading anti-TB drugs manufacturers Macleods and Lupin — with factories at Ankleshwar and Bharuch in Gujarat, Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and Daman in Daman and Diu — have written to the health ministry highlighting that in view of the emergency measures undertaken, availability of manpower and material to the pharmaceutical industry is limited, affecting their production capacity. Health secretary Preeti Sudan has written to an empowered group of government officials to direct the department of pharmaceuticals (DoP) and commerce ministry to ban export of the drugs.

95,"NEW DELHI: A full-scale political battle has broken out between the BJP-led Centre and the Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government, sparked off by the “unannounced” landing of a central team of officials in Kolkata on Monday morning. With West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee viewing the move as an attack on the federal scheme of governance, the TMC accused the Centre of “playing politics at a time when states and the Centre are expected to work together to combat coronavirus”. Banerjee shot off a letter to PM Narendra Modi protesting “breaking of federal norms”. READ ALSO | Bengal obstructing Centre’s Covid-19 teams, says MHAAddressing an online press conference on Tuesday, TMC parliamentary leaders Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O’Brien questioned the Centre’s “intent”. “Why are opposition-governed states like West Bengal being put on targeted watch when states under BJP like Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, or even states like Tamil Nadu and Telangana, governed by friendly parties, with higher positive cases are not being monitored by the Centre,” they asked. “Unfortunately, when Bengal and all other states are fighting coronavirus, the Centre is fighting the states,” O’Brien said, adding, “The Centre refused to call off the budget session of Parliament and delayed a lockdown when the virus was spreading, paying no heed to TMC’s warning on social distancing to be observed, apparently to install a BJP government in Madhya Pradesh.” He further said, “It is a health emergency. Let’s fight it together, not as a state or Centre. Let’s get back to politics after this is over.” Bandopadhyay said, “People want to know what the central ministerial team is looking for, what it has found and why it has not consulted with the chief minister or any state government official on their visit.” He added that the state was coordinating with the Centre and following every guideline. “So, what happened suddenly?” he asked. Asked whether people would suffer if the war against coronavirus got caught in political wrangling, Bandopadhyay said, “Hopefully, good sense will prevail. The Centre will restrain itself in future and will consult state governments for comprehensive and well-structured moves to fight coronavirus and state governments will cooperate.” DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

96,"NEW DELHI: The West Bengal administration’s refusal to provide assistance to the two Inter-Ministerial Central Teams despatched to assist the state can have serious security implications if provisions of the Disaster Management Act are examined as they empower the Centre to deploy military or paramilitary to enforce guidelines issued by the home ministry in any part of the country. Given the sensitivity of the Covid-19 situation, the Centre may choose persuasion or even a hard nudge rather than invoke the more stringent provisions of the law. As it is, the Trinamool Congress has raised the issue of federalism and an emotive outburst of populist emotions will worry the Centre. But at present, the DM Act has been invoked to put the country under lockdown till May 3. The Act overrides all existing laws in the country. In addition, Section 35(2)(f) of the Act empowers the Centre to deploy military or any central paramilitary force to effectively enforce implementation of the guidelines issued under the Act. States are bound to comply with central directives and “make available their resources” to the central team for “responding promptly and effectively to any disaster in the state”. In case of West Bengal, preliminary reports received by the home ministry had indicated “violence on frontline healthcare professionals, complete violations of social distancing norms outside banks, PDS shops and in market places and movement of private and commercial vehicles with passengers in urban areas”. Though in its communication to the chief secretary, the Centre only quoted Sections 35(1), 35(2)(a), 35(2)(e) and 35(2)(i) that talk about coordination, cooperation and securing effective implementation of the DM Act, there are other provisions that provide for arrest of a state official if he or she refuses to abide by the central directives. If there is a showdown between the Centre and states in implementation of disaster management guidelines, the Act empowers the Centre for “deployment of naval, military and air force, other armed forces of the Union or any other civilian personnel as may be required for the purposes of this Act”. While Sections 38 and 39 of the Act make it compulsory that resources of the state are made available to the central team for “responding promptly and effectively” to the disaster, Sections 55 and 56 provide for punishment of up to one year and with fine on failure of any officer of the state “in duty or his connivance at the contravention of the provisions of the Act”.

97,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday said while Maharashtra and Rajasthan were fully cooperating with inter-ministerial teams sent to boost anti-Covid-19 actions, the West Bengal government had restrained the teams sent to Kolkata and Jalpaiguri from functioning, escalating the political battle with Trinamool Congress. Home ministry spokesperson Punya Salila Srivastava said the West Bengal government's actions amounted to obstructing implementation of the order issued on Monday under the Disaster Management Act where state authorities were asked to make arrangements for the IMCTs (inter-ministerial central teams) to assess the ground situation.

In the name of combating the Covid-19 crisis, you're playing with the lives of Bengalis while your leaders use skewed testing numbers for fake propaganda."" The Centre had previously written to West Bengal pointing out that social distancing was being slackly implemented. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the state would implement curbs with a ""human face"". In its previous communication, the home ministry had pointed to reports that the police were allowing religious congregations and people were thronging vegetable, fish and meat markets in several areas. Bhalla said West Bengal’s refusal to assist the teams “amounts to obstructing the implementation of the orders issued by the central government under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and equally binding directions of the Supreme Court”. “You are, therefore, directed to comply with the MHA order dated April 19, 2020, and make all necessary arrangements for the IMCTs to carry out such responsibilities as have been entrusted to them,” he wrote. Two central teams have been deputed to West Bengal to review implementation of lockdown measures in identified districts. The teams are led by additional secretary-level officers and comprise senior public health professionals and NDMA officers, “whose expertise can be leveraged by the state government for management of Covid-19 pandemic”, said the home secretary. Bhalla reminded the state government that the teams were deputed under the authority conferred on the central government under Section 35 of the Disaster Management Act which states that “the central government shall take all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the purpose of disaster management”. He also drew attention to the SC’s observation in its order on March 31 that state governments will faithfully comply with the directives and orders issued by the Union of India in letter and spirit in the interest of public safety. “The said observations of the Supreme Court must be treated as directions and faithfully complied with,” he said.

98,"NEW DELHI: The coronavirus epidemic could peak in India by the middle of May and gradually peter out after that, a modelling exercise by Times Network in partnership with global consulting firm Protiviti, has predicted. The ‘Times Fact India Outbreak Report’ looks at three different possibilities and suggests that India could see the number of coronavirus cases crossing 75,000 around May 22. The team built three models to predict the progression of the coronavirus. Each model provides an estimate of how the outbreak could unfold under different conditions and provides insights on how the government and health infrastructure can respond to the crisis. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesThe report used three models: the percentage model, the time series model and the Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered (SEIR) model. The percentage model uses trends in the spread of the disease in Italy and the US, and applies them onto India to predict its trajectory. Blog: Level the field - News producers can’t keep incurring the costs while digital platforms drain away profitsCoronavirus outbreak: Complete coverageThe time series model takes into consideration data across time periods in China and South Korea, and adapts them to India’s data. The SEIR model is based on an estimation of reproduction rate of the virus, which is the average number of people each positive person infects. Together, the three models provided six projections for the outbreak and give an indication of when it might be safe to lift the lockdown.

The scenarios assume the lockdown is extended beyond May 3 and the reproduction rate of the virus is 0.8, that is, each infected person spreads the disease to 0.8 other people. In the first scenario, if the lockdown is extended to May 15, the case tally will fall to zero by September 15. In the second scenario, if the lockdown is extended to May 30, cases will drop to zero by mid-June.

99,"NEW DELHI: With states complaining that the recently acquired rapid testing kits were delivering misleading and inaccurate results, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday advised all states to stop using the antibody test for Covid-19 for two days until its teams investigated the functioning of the kits. The council said it was investigating the issue as some states had reported huge variations — ranging between 6% and 71% — in test results from rapid antibody kits which it said was unacceptable and may need to be replaced, which will be a setback to the government's plan to use rapid tests for surveillance and tracking trends, though not for diagnostics. On Tuesday morning, Rajasthan — the first state in the country to conduct rapid tests for Covid-19 — decided to stop using the kit any further as it was found that the results were inaccurate and did not correlate with the results of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. This also triggered a reaction across the country with many other states discontinuing the testing. In a tweet late on Tuesday, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said: ""I had earlier suggested to GOI (government of India) that a centralised mechanism with proper guidelines of quality check may be developed for the procurement of medical equipment. Unfortunately this was not accepted. Had this suggestion been accepted, failure of Rapid Test kits could have been avoided. We have written to ICMR for the same."" However, well-placed sources said the tests may not be at fault and might not have been correctly used. ""The kits are not faulty,"" an official familiar with the testing strategy said. ""The use of these kits for diagnosis is at fault. The proper test for Covid is the RT-PCR test. It is possible that states may have resorted to a short-cut in seeing them as diagnostic tests,"" he added. Thanks to this, India’s testing rate has dropped from 35,000-odd on Monday to 27,500 on Tuesday as states are using testing infrastructure for antibody tests. ICMR is expected to issue a detailed clarification soon. There have also been reports that the temperatures needed for the rapid tests have not been observed. More on Covid-19  Coronavirus pandemic: Complete Coverage 21-day lockdown: What will stay open and what won't How to quarantine yourself at home Trust the newspaper for your daily verified news The kits had arrived last week after several delays and have been sourced from three companies based in China. In the first batch, some 3,00,000 kits arrived close to two weeks after they were due. In all, 6,50,000 are to be delivered with more in the pipeline by way of domestic operations in collaboration with foreign firms and other orders that have been placed. The kits are being sent to states based on their requirements. There were complaints from states with the kits meant to be used in hotspots and red zones as a supplement to the polymerase tests that are much more reliable but take more time as it’s are a four-stage procedure to be conducted in labs. ""On Monday, we received a complaint from one state about less detection through rapid antibody test kits. So we asked around three states on Tuesday and found that among positive samples of RT-PCR, there is too much variation in rapid antibody tests,"" said ICMR’s head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, Dr R R Gangakhedkar. ""In some places, 6% to 71% of RT-PCR positive samples were positive,"" he added. ICMR has decided to send eight different teams for testing and validating the kits in the field over the next two days, after which it will issue a fresh advisory on the use of rapid antibody test kits. ""If problems are detected in batches, we will tell the company and can ask them to replace the batches,"" Dr Gangakhedkar said, while asking states to halt testing through the rapid antibody kit till then. While concerns about level of accuracy of rapid antibody tests were raised earlier too, ICMR and the health ministry maintained that the tests were to be used only for surveillance and monitoring of trends. ICMR has recommended only RT-PCR tests for testing individuals who are Covid-19 suspects, which it said was the gold standard. ""This is not a good thing because when such a huge variation is seen, we need to investigate further even if it is the first generation of the test,"" Dr Gangakhedkar said. He, however, said rapid antibody test was a new and first-generation test and would require time to develop further and perform better in new diseases like Covid-19. Highly placed sources in the government told TOI that ICMR had clarified (in government meetings) that rapid test kits show positive reports only after seven days — the period a body needs to generate antibodies that can be detected. They also said that purchases of these kits were made directly by ICMR. ""ICMR was directly involved in procurement of rapid test kits from both China and South Korea. The vendors were approved by the local government,"" said a source. In Rajasthan, a committee submitted its report following a study conducted on rapid tests. ""The SMS Medical College submitted its report to us and they found that those who tested positive in the PCR test have been found negative for Covid-19 in the rapid test. When we correlated the results of PCR and rapid tests, we found that only 5.4% were matching. Ideally, the matching should be at least 90%,"" said Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma. Maharashtra put a last-minute stop on using the rapid test kits. The state had received 75,000 kits and was planning to carry out tests among healthcare workers and subsequently in hotspots such as Mumbai’s Dharavi. The BMC had plans to start testing medical workers using the rapid kits from Wednesday. Dr Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner of the National Health Mission, said that they have decided to wait for 48 hours for the ICMR’s new advisory. West Bengal decided to put rapid tests on hold till it got a clearance from ICMR, Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim said late on Tuesday. Bengal had tested 78 people on Monday and another 220 on Tuesday. Punjab, which was amongst the first states to flag the issue of low accuracy, decided not to use kits provided by the central government. To check the accuracy of the kits, Punjab principal health secretary Anurag Agarwal on April 19 got a survey conducted in Mohali and Jalandhar, the worst-hit districts in the state, by testing positive cases. Random sampling among the general public was also done. In both the categories, a majority of samples collected showed false negative and positive results. In Uttar Pradesh, state surveillance officer for Covid-19 Vikasendu Agarwal said: ""UP will put on hold use of rapid kits after ICMR's observation."" UP had recently used the kits to screen over 10,500 children who returned from Kota. The kits were also used for surveillance in hotspots of Gautam Buddh Nagar. Gujarat too has put its use on hold. ""There are two confirmatory strips — IgM and IgG — in these kits. Both are to turn positive to confirm a case. But in certain cases, only one of the two strips shows results while the other strip fails and hence the case remains inconclusive,"" said principal secretary (health) Jayanthi Ravi. Tamil Nadu, which ordered four lakh rapid antibody testing kits, has put its orders on hold since Saturday. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation managing director P Umanath said his team was re-negotiating the price and re-evaluating the stock required after the ICMR said the tests cannot be used for diagnostic purposes. While Assam and Haryana too have suspended use of these kits, states like Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are yet to begin using them.

Attorney general K K Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices N V Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai that militancy still poses a grave threat to peace in the Kashmir valley and that it would be inappropriate to start the high-speed internet services at this juncture. ""Recently a militant was killed by security forces. Nearly 500 persons attended the funeral despite lockdown,"" the AG said. Justice Ramana-led bench asked petitioners whether the J&K HC had sum moth taken up internet services issue and as to what happened in the case. A petitioner's counsel, Huzefa Ahmadi, told the bench that the HC had taken up a whole gamut of issues, including internet services. ""Our specific issue is that in the absence of 4G services it is difficult to hold video conferencing, which hampers doctors from consulting other experts and give advice to their patients, the professionals cannot enter into any contract for supply and purchase of food produce and material, and nearly 2,200 private schools have been hampered in their effort to provide online classes to their students,"" he said. The SC had sought response of the J&K administration on April 10 on a petition filed by an association of journalists. Two subsequent PILs were filed by a lawyer and 'Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir', which complained that in the absence of 4G it could not impart online instructions to its students, as was being done by private schools in other states. The association of private schools also said that non-provision of 4G services violated the fundamental right to education of children. The school association's counsel told the court that about 2,200 private schools are unable to hold online classes jeopardising ongoing academic session of 22 lakh students, most of whom have tabs or laptops but there is no 4G internet connectivity required for online classes. SC asked the J&K agovernment and the Centre to file a detailed affidavit on this issue and said it would take up hearing on Monday.

102,"NEW DELHI: The Union government has asked the states and union territories to remain cautious and ensure that there are no prayer gatherings during the Islamic holy month of Ramzan beginning Thursday in view of the ongoing lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak, officials said. The central government has also asked the state governments and UT administrations to urge Muslim leaders to ask their followers to remain at home. ""Prayers and gatherings at any religious place are prohibited during lockdown and we hope that everyone will abide by the directive,"" a senior government official told PTI. The state governments have been told to be in touch with Muslim leaders to ensure that there are no gatherings in mosques and people must pray at home, the official said. The central government conveyed this to the states and UTs after receiving inputs that people may gather in mosques in some parts of the country for 'Taraweeh' prayers, which are normally conducted in mosques in the evening. According to the revised consolidated guidelines issued by the Home Ministry on April 15, all religious places and places of worship shall be closed for public. Religious congregations are strictly prohibited during the lockdown, which will continue till May 3. The state governments were also told to reach out to mosque management committees and community leaders through local police so that no one visits mosques for prayers, another official said. Even though several Muslim organisations and clerics have appealed to people to pray at home during Ramzan, authorities are apprehensive in view of detection of a large number of people at Tablighi Jamaat headquarters at Nizamuddin in Delhi despite the lockdown and social distancing orders. The Nizamuddin Markaz also hosted a large religious congregation last month and authorities said 30 per cent of India's total Covid-19 cases were linked to it as many of those who attended the meeting or those who had come in contact with the attendees tested positive for the infection. During the month of Ramzan, Muslims observe dawn-to-dusk fast and hold community prayers. There are also iftar feasts where people gather for a community meal in the evening.

103,"NEW DELHI: Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Tuesday asserted that there is no shortage of food grains for the poor and asked Rahul Gandhi to shun his ""negative mindset"" after the Congress leader attacked the Centre over its decision to use surplus rice for making ethanol. The ethanol can be used to produce alcohol-based hand sanitisers and also for blending with petrol, the government has said. After Rahul Gandhi accused the government of diverting the rice meant for the poor to manufacture sanitizers to wash hands of the rich, Paswan hit back at him and questioned if he does not want the economically weaker sections to use sanitizers and masks. ""Does he (Gandhi) want only the rich to use sanitizers and masks while India battles the coronavirus? Should the poor be left to die? It is our long-term planning to have so much sanitizers that the poor can also afford it. He should shun this negative mindset which is dangerous for the country,"" Paswan told reporters. Sources in the ruling BJP-led NDA said it was decided to field Paswan to take on Rahul Gandhi as the matter is related to his ministry, and he is also seen as a credible voice on the matter. Paswan said the Modi government is committed to the poor and it has over 18 months stock of grains to supply over 81 crore beneficiaries of the public distribution system (PDS). ""One priority is that nobody goes hungry. I believe it is wrong to say that things like sanitizers or masks are for the use of the rich. We want that even poor can use them,"" Paswan said. While the central government has made adequate provision of grains, it is the responsibility of states to ensure that they are supplied to intended beneficiaries in time, he added. Rahul Gandhi should rather find out if poor people in some places are still hungry and bring it to the notice of the state concerned or the Centre, the Lok Janshakti Party leader said. He noted that the government had already announced free ration for three months to PDS beneficiaries and asked states to give them three month of rations on credit. Rahul had alleged that while the poor are dying of hunger, the government is allowing rice to be used for making sanitisers. ""After all, when will India's poor wake up? You are dying of hunger and they are busy cleaning the hands of the rich by making sanitizers from your portion of rice,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi.

104,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government on Tuesday sought from the Centre an interim compensation of Rs 3,000 crore for the month of April in view of ""alarming resource gap"" and also demanded permission for sale of liquor to mobilise excise revenue. Pointing to the alarming resource gap between the state's anticipated receipts and committed expenditure, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday demanded interim compensation to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore for the month of April on account of the COVID-19 national disaster, said a government statement here. In a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the chief minister also asked for expediting the release of the state's GST arrears of Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months, to help overcome resource constraint. Stating that the lockdown had substantial fiscal consequences for all states, Singh said the central government should compensate Punjab for its loss of revenue due to COVID-19. While the Rs 3,000 crore for April was an estimate, he said ""detailed assessment of loss and requirement of funds for relief and rehabilitation will be submitted in due course,"". However, he stressed that the Centre should provide interim assistance so that the fight against COVID-19 is not allowed to weaken in any way. Punjab was facing huge stress on account of the required health and relief measures that are being continuously scaled up, ""with hardly any revenue receipts accruing to the state during these days due to near-complete shutdown of trade, business and industry"", the chief minister said. The state government had made a provision of revenue receipts of Rs 3,360 crore for the month of April 2020 in the state budget 2020-21. It comprised Rs 1,322 crore of GST, Rs 465 crore of VAT on petroleum, Rs 521 crore state excise revenue, Rs 198 crore of Motor Vehicle Tax, Rs 243 crore of electricity duty, Rs 219 crore of stamp duty and non-tax revenue of Rs 392 crore. The chief minister observed that these receipts are expected to decline sharply as most economic activities in the state remain closed on account of the lockdown. The receipts on account of state GST, integrated GST, VAT, excise, stamp duty and motor vehicle taxes are almost negligible and the reduced electricity consumption has resulted in a drop of 60 per cent of the expected revenue from electricity duty during April 2020, he said. On the other hand, he pointed out, the committed expenditure of the state which is debt servicing, pensions, salaries, relief measures for COVID-19, health care and infrastructure etc., is budgeted at Rs 7,301 crore for the month of April 2020, resulting in the huge resource gap between the anticipated receipts and committed expenditure. Pointing to the critical fiscal situation of the state, the CM also sought the Centre's permission to allow sale of liquor, in a phased manner, to mop up value-added tax and excise revenue. The Home Ministry should allow the state to take a conscious decision to allow the sale of liquor in certain areas in a phased manner with strict social distancing and other measures to prevent COVID-19"", he said. This would help the state immensely in its efforts to scale up the relief and health care measures to combat COVID-19 and meet some, if not all, of its committed liabilities and other day-to-day expenses, he said. Singh requested the Home Minister for early action, while assuring him of the state's full and continued support in the efforts of the government of India to overcome the present crisis by effectively managing and containing the COVID-19. Notably, the Punjab government has projected collection of Rs 6,250 crore from the sale of liquor for 2020-21 in the state, which is known for its high consumption.

So there's no one to smear cake on the birthday girl's face and promises instead of gifts as every guest -- not half as many as most party hoppers would like -- is kept at 'you-can-see-but-can't-touch' distance, the party itself taking on a futuristic, otherworldly quality to remember in a post coronavirus tomorrow. In middle and upper-class homes, birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and even pre-wedding celebrations have gone virtual after March 25, when the pan India lockdown came into force. Reducing distances but also enhancing them, the shared parties are dependent, of course, on the partygoer's broadband connection or mobile data package. Mohammad Omar, a Masters student at London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), who returned to India in March, had a 22nd birthday he will always remember. He said he was feeling really low on his birthday on April 3, but a video conference cheered him up. ""All my cousins and friends arranged a video conference which I was unaware of. My cousin who lives next door called me over and I was stunned to see my friends and cousins waiting at a video conference on her laptop,"" the 22-year-old from Ghaziabad said. ""They sang for me, we even danced on a few songs and I cut the cake baked by my mother, but missed being smeared with icing by my friends and cousins,"" he told PTI. Children are also trying to wrap their heads around the strange birthday celebrations. Parents are struggling to explain to their children why a mega bash is not possible this year. Shahana Datta, who turned eight on April 7, missed her friends and cousins who would come to her Noida home every birthday, but could not make it this time. ""I felt very sad that I could not meet my friends and cousins on my birthday. But my mother made a cake for me and when I was cutting it, my cousins and friends joined in on a video call to sing for me,"" she told PTI. Shahana said her mother has promised her many gifts â€œonce coronavirus die and the lockdown is over. The young ones just can't figure out what the big deal about COVID-19 is. Neetu Thakur said her son Vedant was extremely upset on his seventh birthday on April 15 as he could not understand why his party couldn't happen in a mall or a banquet hall like every other year. ""To cheer him up, I decorated the entire house with whatever material at hand, baked a cake for him and made him connect with his cousins and grandparents on the video call,"" said Thakur, a resident of Srinivaspuri in Delhi. ""I bought two-three small gifts from nearby shops and promised my son that when the lockdown opens, I will buy his favourite toys and lots of other gifts,"" she told PTI. The blues have hit other celebrations too. I H Rehman, an environment expert who lives in Ghaziabad, said his 24th marriage anniversary on April 15 was a sombre affair with a quiet dinner and a home-baked cake. The 53-year-old said he has promised to buy his wife a ""big gift"" once the lockdown is lifted. In a non-coronavirus year, Anindya Basu and his family would have rung in the Bengali New Year by going out for a series of feasts with friends and relatives in town. But the plans had to be tweaked this year. This year, we spent a formidable amount of time calling up all the relatives and wishing them. The kids dressed up in new clothes, and were made to sit down for a detailed lesson on the significance of the day in our culture, after which we treated ourselves to a homemade gala lunch, the Kolkata-based Basu said. Basu and his wife Madhushree, both foodies, whipped up an exquisite menu comprising quintessential Bengali delicacies like ghee bhaat' (rice served with clarified butter) and â€˜katla maccher kalia' (Catla fish curry). Many others also took to Twitter to share how they are celebrating various special occasions. Prometheus School in Noida hosted a special morning assembly to celebrate Baisakhi, the harvest festival. In an online video chat, students and teachers dressed up in traditional attire and shook a leg to some Punjabi music tracks. A couple had to postpone their wedding due to the lockdown. However, they shared a post on how their friends threw them a virtual sangeet party to make the day memorable. Our friends threw us a 'BawaMani' Virtual Sangeet Party since our wedding couldn't take place this weekend! Our hearts are full of love for these bums who made our day, the bride tweeted. Theatre actor Dipali Bhasin's family chalked out an extensive itinerary for her quarantine birthday, a picture of which she shared on Twitter. It started with breakfast in bed, and had activities like movie viewing, free/nap time, cocktail hours, dinner and a surprise at 6, she said. Extraordinary times sometimes call for extraordinary gestures. Like this one from police in Punjab's Mansa district which delivered a cake at the doorstep of a one-year-old. The warm gesture of the police personnel won many hearts and left the parents of the girl elated. There are also some who just can't stick to online. A man in Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur district demonstrated birthday over-enthusiasm when he defied the lockdown with a big party on his 10-year-old son's birthday. A case has been registered against the man, who is a trader, and some unidentified persons after a video of the event went viral on social media, according to the police. Till such time when the shadow of the pandemic vanishes, ""Happy birthday to you"" on video may just become the new normal for connected India.

108,"NEW DELHI: With PILs by journalists, lawyers and association of private schools pleading for 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre and the Union Territory to explain by Monday why high-speed internet services be not resumed in the valley to aid health, education and business sectors during lockdown period. Attorney general K K Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices N V Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai that militancy still poses a grave threat to peace in the Kashmir valley and that it would be inappropriate to start the high-speed internet services at this juncture. ""Recently a militant was killed by security forces. Nearly 500 persons attended the funeral despite lockdown,"" the AG said. Justice Ramana-led bench asked petitioners whether the J&K HC had sum moth taken up internet services issue and as to what happened in the case. A petitioner's counsel, Huzefa Ahmadi, told the bench that the HC had taken up a whole gamut of issues, including internet services. ""Our specific issue is that in the absence of 4G services it is difficult to hold video conferencing, which hampers doctors from consulting other experts and give advice to their patients, the professionals cannot enter into any contract for supply and purchase of food produce and material, and nearly 2,200 private schools have been hampered in their effort to provide online classes to their students,"" he said. The SC had sought response of the J&K administration on April 10 on a petition filed by an association of journalists. Two subsequent PILs were filed by a lawyer and 'Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir', which complained that in the absence of 4G it could not impart online instructions to its students, as was being done by private schools in other states. The association of private schools also said that non-provision of 4G services violated the fundamental right to education of children. The school association's counsel told the court that about 2,200 private schools are unable to hold online classes jeopardising ongoing academic session of 22 lakh students, most of whom have tabs or laptops but there is no 4G internet connectivity required for online classes. SC asked the J&K agovernment and the Centre to file a detailed affidavit on this issue and said it would take up hearing on Monday.

110,"NEW DELHI: The Union government has asked the states and union territories to remain cautious and ensure that there are no prayer gatherings during the Islamic holy month of Ramzan beginning Thursday in view of the ongoing lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak, officials said. The central government has also asked the state governments and UT administrations to urge Muslim leaders to ask their followers to remain at home. ""Prayers and gatherings at any religious place are prohibited during lockdown and we hope that everyone will abide by the directive,"" a senior government official told PTI. The state governments have been told to be in touch with Muslim leaders to ensure that there are no gatherings in mosques and people must pray at home, the official said. The central government conveyed this to the states and UTs after receiving inputs that people may gather in mosques in some parts of the country for 'Taraweeh' prayers, which are normally conducted in mosques in the evening. According to the revised consolidated guidelines issued by the Home Ministry on April 15, all religious places and places of worship shall be closed for public. Religious congregations are strictly prohibited during the lockdown, which will continue till May 3. The state governments were also told to reach out to mosque management committees and community leaders through local police so that no one visits mosques for prayers, another official said. Even though several Muslim organisations and clerics have appealed to people to pray at home during Ramzan, authorities are apprehensive in view of detection of a large number of people at Tablighi Jamaat headquarters at Nizamuddin in Delhi despite the lockdown and social distancing orders. The Nizamuddin Markaz also hosted a large religious congregation last month and authorities said 30 per cent of India's total Covid-19 cases were linked to it as many of those who attended the meeting or those who had come in contact with the attendees tested positive for the infection. During the month of Ramzan, Muslims observe dawn-to-dusk fast and hold community prayers. There are also iftar feasts where people gather for a community meal in the evening.

111,"NEW DELHI: Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Tuesday asserted that there is no shortage of food grains for the poor and asked Rahul Gandhi to shun his ""negative mindset"" after the Congress leader attacked the Centre over its decision to use surplus rice for making ethanol. The ethanol can be used to produce alcohol-based hand sanitisers and also for blending with petrol, the government has said. After Rahul Gandhi accused the government of diverting the rice meant for the poor to manufacture sanitizers to wash hands of the rich, Paswan hit back at him and questioned if he does not want the economically weaker sections to use sanitizers and masks. ""Does he (Gandhi) want only the rich to use sanitizers and masks while India battles the coronavirus? Should the poor be left to die? It is our long-term planning to have so much sanitizers that the poor can also afford it. He should shun this negative mindset which is dangerous for the country,"" Paswan told reporters. Sources in the ruling BJP-led NDA said it was decided to field Paswan to take on Rahul Gandhi as the matter is related to his ministry, and he is also seen as a credible voice on the matter. Paswan said the Modi government is committed to the poor and it has over 18 months stock of grains to supply over 81 crore beneficiaries of the public distribution system (PDS). ""One priority is that nobody goes hungry. I believe it is wrong to say that things like sanitizers or masks are for the use of the rich. We want that even poor can use them,"" Paswan said. While the central government has made adequate provision of grains, it is the responsibility of states to ensure that they are supplied to intended beneficiaries in time, he added. Rahul Gandhi should rather find out if poor people in some places are still hungry and bring it to the notice of the state concerned or the Centre, the Lok Janshakti Party leader said. He noted that the government had already announced free ration for three months to PDS beneficiaries and asked states to give them three month of rations on credit. Rahul had alleged that while the poor are dying of hunger, the government is allowing rice to be used for making sanitisers. ""After all, when will India's poor wake up? You are dying of hunger and they are busy cleaning the hands of the rich by making sanitizers from your portion of rice,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi.

112,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government on Tuesday sought from the Centre an interim compensation of Rs 3,000 crore for the month of April in view of ""alarming resource gap"" and also demanded permission for sale of liquor to mobilise excise revenue. Pointing to the alarming resource gap between the state's anticipated receipts and committed expenditure, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday demanded interim compensation to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore for the month of April on account of the COVID-19 national disaster, said a government statement here. In a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the chief minister also asked for expediting the release of the state's GST arrears of Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months, to help overcome resource constraint. Stating that the lockdown had substantial fiscal consequences for all states, Singh said the central government should compensate Punjab for its loss of revenue due to COVID-19. While the Rs 3,000 crore for April was an estimate, he said ""detailed assessment of loss and requirement of funds for relief and rehabilitation will be submitted in due course,"". However, he stressed that the Centre should provide interim assistance so that the fight against COVID-19 is not allowed to weaken in any way. Punjab was facing huge stress on account of the required health and relief measures that are being continuously scaled up, ""with hardly any revenue receipts accruing to the state during these days due to near-complete shutdown of trade, business and industry"", the chief minister said. The state government had made a provision of revenue receipts of Rs 3,360 crore for the month of April 2020 in the state budget 2020-21. It comprised Rs 1,322 crore of GST, Rs 465 crore of VAT on petroleum, Rs 521 crore state excise revenue, Rs 198 crore of Motor Vehicle Tax, Rs 243 crore of electricity duty, Rs 219 crore of stamp duty and non-tax revenue of Rs 392 crore. The chief minister observed that these receipts are expected to decline sharply as most economic activities in the state remain closed on account of the lockdown. The receipts on account of state GST, integrated GST, VAT, excise, stamp duty and motor vehicle taxes are almost negligible and the reduced electricity consumption has resulted in a drop of 60 per cent of the expected revenue from electricity duty during April 2020, he said. On the other hand, he pointed out, the committed expenditure of the state which is debt servicing, pensions, salaries, relief measures for COVID-19, health care and infrastructure etc., is budgeted at Rs 7,301 crore for the month of April 2020, resulting in the huge resource gap between the anticipated receipts and committed expenditure. Pointing to the critical fiscal situation of the state, the CM also sought the Centre's permission to allow sale of liquor, in a phased manner, to mop up value-added tax and excise revenue. The Home Ministry should allow the state to take a conscious decision to allow the sale of liquor in certain areas in a phased manner with strict social distancing and other measures to prevent COVID-19"", he said. This would help the state immensely in its efforts to scale up the relief and health care measures to combat COVID-19 and meet some, if not all, of its committed liabilities and other day-to-day expenses, he said. Singh requested the Home Minister for early action, while assuring him of the state's full and continued support in the efforts of the government of India to overcome the present crisis by effectively managing and containing the COVID-19. Notably, the Punjab government has projected collection of Rs 6,250 crore from the sale of liquor for 2020-21 in the state, which is known for its high consumption.

As many as 28,000 doctors from across the state will take part in a candlelight vigil at their respective places at 9pm on April 22, secretary of the IMA's Gujarat chapter Dr Kamlesh Saini said. ""The call was given by the IMA headquarters after several cases of violence and discrimination against doctors were reported across the country. In Chennai, locals even refused burial to a doctor who had died treating coronavirus patients.

114,"NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Tuesday said the West Bengal government is obstructing the implementation of its order by refusing to cooperate with the inter-ministerial central teams (IMCTs) in Kolkata and Jalpaiguri that have been sent to assess the COVID-19 situation. The MHA directed the state authorities to comply with the order by making all necessary arrangements for the IMCTs to carry out their responsibilities. “It has been brought to the notice of this ministry that both the IMCTs, at Kolkata and Jalpaiguri respectively, have not been provided with the requisite co-operation by the state and local authorities. In fact, they have been specifically restrained from making any visits, interacting with health professionals, and assessing the ground level situation,” home secretary Ajay Bhalla said in a letter sent to the West Bengal chief secretary. Bhalla said West Bengal’s refusal to assist the teams “amounts to obstructing the implementation of the orders issued by the Central Government under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and equally binding directions of the Supreme Court”. “You are, therefore, directed to comply with the MHA order dated April 19, 2020 and make all necessary arrangements for the IMCTs to carry out such responsibilities as have been entrusted to them vide the aforesaid order,” the home secretary wrote. Two central teams have been deputed to West Bengal to review the implementation of lockdown measures after making on-spot assessment of the situation prevailing in identified select districts. The teams are led by additional secretary-level officers and comprise senior public health professionals and NDMA officers, “whose expertise can be leveraged by the state government for management of COVID-19 pandemic,” said the home secretary. Bhalla reminded the state government that the teams were deputed under the authority conferred on the Central Government under Section 35 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 which states that ... ”The Central Government shall take all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the purpose of disaster management”. He also drew attention to the Supreme Court’s observation in its order dated 31.03.2020, that the state governments will faithfully comply with the directives and orders issued by the Union of India in letter and spirit in the interest of public safety. “The said observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court must be treated as directions and faithfully complied with,” he said. “In view of the powers exercised by the Central Government under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the clear directions Of the Supreme Court, the obligations imposed on the state governments in the interest Of preventing the spread of Covid-19 must be strictly followed,” noted the home secretary.

119,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday said India was doing the best possible as per its capabilities to combat the Covid-19 outbreak and that one must have faith in science which was making fast advances towards developing a vaccine and therapeutic interventions. The comments came in the wake of WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus alluding to the Spanish flu in 1918 as a reference for the coronavirus outbreak and saying the worst was to come in the coronavirus outbreak, raising new alarm bells about the pandemic just as many countries are beginning to ease restrictive measures.

One, it allowed time for preparedness, to create health infrastructure like hospitals to provide treatment to infected people, and two, it helped buy time while science is progressing fast to develop interventions to combat the disease which is very new. He added that while new drugs and vaccines are in the pipeline, India too will benefit from them when the lockdown is lifted, even as cases will be in control due to these measures.

120,"NEW DELHI: Covid-19 tests that delivered positive results in India so far show 69% positive cases were asymptomatic, whereas 31% are symptomatic representing a ratio of 1:2, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Tuesday. So far, over four lakh samples have been tested for Covid-19 in India and of these 18,601 were positive. ICMR head of epidemiology and communicable diseases Dr R R Gangakhedkar said, “There is only one study that suggests there are 80% cases. Secondly in case of asymptomatic, where the symptoms are not very clear, the chances of patient coming and reporting the case too becomes low. I am now saying for the first time that if we look at the number of tests done, so far 31% belong to the symptomatic category and the rest 69% would fall under asymptomatic...we can say that for every single case detected there would be about two cases that may be termed as asymptomatic.” More on Covid-19  Coronavirus pandemic: Complete Coverage 21-day lockdown: What will stay open and what won't How to quarantine yourself at home Trust the newspaper for your daily verified news Seeking to address concerns over asymptomatic cases, the health ministry said they include those with mild and sometimes “very mild” symptoms and efforts are on to identify such cases through contact tracing and community surveillance. Citing observations of the WHO, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said there are three phases : purely asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic, and in common parlance even pre-symptomatic cases are called asymptomatic when the symptoms are mild. “We are working with a pre-emptive approach while working on community surveillance. If we find a so called asymptomatic case in a field with high risk or direct contact, then we collect even that sample for testing. In that case, when a person has even mild symptom, the test is positive. This way we can timely identify and reduce mortality,” Agarwal said. Officials said there is a probability that there are several asymptomatic persons who may not know that they carried the virus for a while, but the numbers so far are not seen to be so high as to represent a threat of undetected transmission on a significant scale. If that were to be the case, there would be a higher number of positive cases as well who needed medical attention. The official also added that the testing strategy is not static and if more attention was needed in the case of asymptomatic persons, the protocols would be revised afresh. According to WHO, pre-symptomatic period is the incubation interval for Covid-19 — between exposure turning into infection and symptom onset. This period is on average five to six days but can be up to 14 days. During this period, some infected persons can be contagious. Therefore, transmission from a pre-symptomatic case can occur before symptom onset. A truly asymptomatic case is a confirmed case in a person infected with Covid-19 who does not develop symptom.

121,"JAMMU: People living along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu & Kashmir have been braving enemies on two fronts with fear of coronavirus and frequent firing by Pakistan keeping them inside their houses for long hours. Pakistan on Tuesday yet again violated ceasefire by resorting to unprovoked firing and shelling along the LoC in Poonch district twice in a day. “Around 11.20am, Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing with small arms and shelling with mortars along the LoC in Kerni sector of Poonch district,” a defence spokesperson said. He added that Indian Army retaliated befittingly and there was no casualty or any major damage to property. Pakistan troops violated the ceasefire for the second time along the LoC with unprovoked firing and shelling in Kerni and Qasba sectors of Poonch district. “Aroun 5.20pm on Tuesday, Pakistan again initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing with small arms and shelling with mortars along the LoC in Kerni & Qasba sectors of Poonch,” the defence spokesperson said. There has been a spurt in ceasefire violations by Pakistan since August 2019 when India revoked Article 370 from J&K and bifurcated it into two union territories. Over 3,200 ceasefire violations by Pakistan’s troops were recorded in 2019 along the LoC and the international border, while this year also has witnessed over 600 ceasefire violations. Due to continuous ceasefire violations by Pakistan, there is panic among people living along the border amid the ongoing threat of coronavirus. Kerni, Balakote, Mankote, Qasba in Poonch district; Laam, Nowshera, Sunderbandi, Manjakote in Rajouri district and Hiranagar, Samba, Ramgarh sectors in Kathua and Samba districts are worst-affected due to the repeated ceasefire violations since a month.

123,"SRINAGAR: As many as 150 girls from Below Poverty Line (BPL) families in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district — which has the highest number of coronavirus-positive patients in J&K with 91 confirmed cases as per official figures — have made at least one lakh masks to fight the pandemic. The masks were made under the centrally-sponsored National Rural Livelihood Scheme (NRLS) and will be sold at Rs 7 each. The target is to stitch three lakh more. Haseena Qasim (26), a postgraduate in Kashmiri language and the cluster coordinator in the district under the NRL scheme, said the exercise was their own way of contributing to the fight against the global pandemic. “We were guided about the design by the rural development department’s block programme officer Arif Jan. We have a target of making four lakh masks for the district,” she said, adding that masks will be sold to Bandipora residents via the deputy commissioner’s office. Haseena, who lives in Nowgam in Sumbal, has stitched around 2800 masks alone. Mymoona Ali (23) from Nowgam, along with a group of girls under the ‘Ummeed’ self-help programme, have joined the cause. “Since April 9, we have stitched at least 8338 masks and supplied them to the district administration,” Mymoona said. Like Haseena and Mymoona, the Ummeed programme has benefitted many other women from BPL families who have been robbed of employment opportunities because of the lockdown and helped them continue supporting their kin. “The work gives us happiness that we are able to do something for the people, while also helping us earn our livelihood. Lives are precious and our priority is stitching as many masks as possible, without thinking about money,” Haseena said. Block programme officer Arif Jan said, “We have covered three blocks and engaged 150 girls from Bandipora’s BPL families in making masks for residents and healthcare workers as well. So far, we have received around one lakh masks from these girls. The target is four lakh. We are yet to decide on the final price of the masks, but are planning to sell them for Rs 7 each.” As per official figures, Bandipora has 91 Covid-positive patients so far, the highest in J&K.

124,"MUMBAI: With the High Court refusing to interfere, all eyes are now on Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari who will have to take a decision on nominating chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to the Legislative Council. The Bombay high court on Monday refused interim relief on a BJP worker's plea opposing the state cabinet's recommendation that Thackeray be appointed as governor's nominee. Adjourning the petition filed by a BJP worker, the HC said the governor is expected to consider legal validity of the recommendation. Thackeray, who is not a member of either house of Maharashtra legislature, took oath as chief minister on November 28, 2019. Under the Constitution, he has to become member of the legislature by May 28, 2020. However, all elections were postponed due to the coronavirus epidemic, so the state cabinet on April 9 recommended that he be nominated to the Council from the governor's quota. Under Article 171 of the Constitution,the governor can nominate members having special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social service. There are currently two vacancies among members from governor's quota due to resignations of NCP legislators who joined the BJP before the assembly polls. The NCP, now part of the ruling coalition, had recommended two names for the vacancies earlier this year, but the governor rejected them saying the term of these two seats will end in June and there was no need for immediate appointment. Constitutional experts cite a 1961 Supreme Court ruling on the appointment of Chandrabhan Gupta as Uttar Pradesh chief minister and his nomination to the Legislative Council by the Governor. The SC had upheld his appointment. The apex court had held that Gupta had taken active part in politics for several years, which amounted to having experience of social service, so he was qualified to be nominated to the legislative council. Discussing the options before the government, former principal secretary of the legislature Anant Kalse said the government should approach the Election Commission of India and seek biennial elections to nine Legislative Council seats before May 27. Or it can request the Governor to take a decision on the cabinet recommendation of April 9 at the earliest, he said. The government can also move the high court or the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the governor, Kalse said. The courts have ruled in the past that cabinet's recommendations are binding on the governor, he added.

129,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended its guidelines issued to prevent the spread of coronavirus in children's homes to Nari Niketans or women's shelter homes and asked the government to look into the possibility of releasing the inmates wherever feasible to avoid overcrowding. A bench of Justices N V Ramana, S K Kaul and B R Gavai said state governments should assess the ground situation and take appropriate steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus at the women shelter homes. The top court had on April 3, taking suo motu note of conditions and preparedness of children's homes across the country in view of pandemic, issued a slew of directions to state governments and the authorities concerned to prevent the spread of coronavirus, or COVID-19.

137,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended its guidelines issued to prevent the spread of coronavirus in children's homes to Nari Niketans or women's shelter homes and asked the government to look into the possibility of releasing the inmates wherever feasible to avoid overcrowding. A bench of Justices N V Ramana, S K Kaul and B R Gavai said state governments should assess the ground situation and take appropriate steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus at the women shelter homes. The top court had on April 3, taking suo motu note of conditions and preparedness of children's homes across the country in view of pandemic, issued a slew of directions to state governments and the authorities concerned to prevent the spread of coronavirus, or COVID-19. During the hearing, advocate Shoeb Alam, appearing for petitioner Rishad Murtaza, said that looking at the situation due to the pandemic, he was seeking extension of the April 3 guidelines to Nari Niketans or women's shelter homes. He said several adult women were staying in these homes involuntarily and they should be released to prevent overcrowding in these shelter homes. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said however that even the accused in jails, who are being released, are facing difficulty in going home due to the lockdown protocols. The bench said that it is directing the government to look into the matter and concerns raised in the petition and wherever it is feasible, the women should be released after assessing the ground situation. The petition, filed through advocate Fauzia Shakil, said the deadly and extremely contagious coronavirus / COVID-19 outbreak has triggered a global pandemic and panic. ""That the number of COVID-19 patients are increasing across the country. Most of these Nari Niketans /Women Shelter Homes are overcrowded and the residents live in sub-standard and unhygienic conditions. The health and wellbeing of the residents... are in jeopardy. There is an immediate need to take steps to prevent the contagion of COVID 19 in Nari Niketans/Woman Homes etc across the country,” it said. The plea said the living conditions at Nari Niketans are deplorable and unhygienic making women there vulnerable to the pandemic. It said that the overcrowding in Nari Niketans will make it difficult for the inmates to maintain social distancing. “It is submitted that like most of the viral diseases, the susceptibility of COVID-9 is greater in over-crowded places, mass gatherings, etc”.

143,"NEW DELHI: Even before the war against Corona is far from over, a full scale political battle has broken out between the BJP-ruled Centre and the Trinamool Congress-ruled West Bengal government, sparked off by the “unannounced” landing of central team of officials in Kolkata on Monday morning. With West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief, Mamata Banerjee, reading the move as an affront to federal norms of governance, the TMC has accused the Centre of “playing politics at a time when states and the Centre are expected to work together to combat Corona. Addressing the media, Banerjee shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring the issue of “breaking federal norms” to his notice, on Monday evening. On Tuesday, TMC parliamentary leaders Sudip Bandopadhyay and Derek O’Brien questioned “the intent of the Centre,” while asking, “why Opposition-ruled states like Bengal are being put on targeted watch when BJP-ruled states like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh or even states like Tamil Nadu and Telengana ruled by friendly parties, with high rise in Corona-positive cases were not being monitored by the Centre."" ""Centre should clearly say why the central has come, then there should be no problem if there is no ill intention behind this,” said Bandopadhyay, when asked why the state government was outraged by the move. “Unfortunately when Bengal and all the other states are fighting Corona, the Centre is fighting the states,” said O’Brien, alleging that the Centre refused to call off Budget session (of Parliament) and delayed a lockdown when the virus was spreading, paying no heed to TMC’s warning on social distancing to be observed, apparently to install a BJP government in Madhya Pradesh. “It is a health emergency. Let’s fight it together, not as state, or Centre. Let’s get back to politics after this (Corona) is over,” he said. Bandopadhyay said, “people want to know what the central ministerial team is looking for, what they have found and why it has consulted with the chief minister or any state government officials on their purpose of visit,” making it clear that the ruling TMC did not welcome such political moves when the state is functioning in ""coordination with the Centre, keeping in line with every guideline laid down by NICED to combat Corona,"" he said. Asked whether people will suffer if the war against Corona gets caught in a political turmoil, Bandopadhyay said, “hopefully good sense will prevail.

In a letter to Drinking Water and Sanitation Secretary Parameswaran Iyer, who is also the chairman of the empowered group for facilitating supply chain and logistics management, she said, ""In view of the emergency measures undertaken, the availability of limited number of manpower and material to the pharmaceutical industry, the production capacity of the leading anti-TB drug manufacturers of India has been affected."" Such a situation will worsen the treatment of TB patients within the country, she added.Sudan said suppliers have communicated that anti-TB drug supplies will be delayed because ""force majeure"" due to COVID-19 response activities, limited material (API), for production, limited manpower (because of restrictions) and limited transportation facilities. The leading anti-TB drugs manufacturers at present having contract agreement with National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) are Macleods and Lupin.

'The World Press Freedom Index 2020' said that with no murders of journalists in India in 2019, as against six in 2018, the security situation for the country's media might seem, on the face of it, to have improved. ""However, there have been constant press freedom violations, including police violence against journalists, ambushes by political activists, and reprisals instigated by criminal groups or corrupt local officials,"" it said. It attributed the decline in index to ""pressure on the media to toe the Hindu nationalist government's line."" The ""coordinated hate campaigns"" waged on social networks against journalists who dare to speak or write about subjects that annoy Hindutva followers are ""alarming"", it said. ""The campaigns are particularly virulent when the targets are women,"" it said.

Use of masks has been made mandatory for everyone going out. Every member of a priority or AAY household will get one free of cost mask, while others will get it at a subsidy,” Kansal said. He said religious leaders and others have been appealing to avoid all gatherings and people must heed them. Kansal said the strategy of aggressive tracing and increased testing would continue. “We will further strengthen our surveillance system and procedure.

With the government making wearing of masks mandatory in public and at the workplace, these come at a cost Rs 5.94 each against the market price of Rs 7.50 and could well serve to meet the rising demand of masks in the coming days.

A Delhi Residents' Welfare Association is the Northern Railways' first paying client and received the first batch of these masks on Tuesday. With the government making wearing of masks mandatory in public and at the workplace, these come at a cost Rs 5.94 each against the market price of Rs 7.50 and could well serve to meet the rising demand of masks in the coming days. Its USP of being a multi-use mask gives it a leg up from the ordinary masks which have to be disposed off after every use, making it an expensive affair for any household. Since the priority for railways is to cater to the needs of its employees, the masks made by the zone will first be distributed among its 1.3 lakh employees. The workshops under the zone have already manufactured 35,000 masks, officials said, adding that by May end the figure is likely to touch a lakh. ""They are such a hit now that some RWA's have shown interest in them and are placing orders. They are made of surplus cloth meant for uniforms for our employees which remained unused. We have received orders from a RWA and we will be supplying them with the reusable masks,"" Arun Arora, Principal Chief Mechanical Engineer of Northern Railway told PTI. The zone will be fabricating 10,000 such masks every week, some of which will be given to railway employees while others will be given to associations which are requesting them on a payment basis, he said. The Jagadhri Workshop of northern railway has in fact also made disposable masks for the railways' medical staff, the cloth for which is being bought separately. The washable masks are currently in use in the five divisions of northern railway, RDSO Lucknow and by its own workshop staff, besides the railway hospitals where the disposable ones are being used. ""We want people to know that we are making these masks, that they are available and we will ramp up production if needed,"" said Arora. However, it is not just masks that the zone is manufacturing to augment the government's efforts to fight coronavirus, specially in areas where there is major shortfall. It has produced DRDO approved coveralls for medical staff and hand sanitisers for their staffers. While the railways' coveralls come for Rs 447, similar pieces in the market are pegged at Rs 808.

166,"KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: The face-off between the Centre and West Bengal over the visit of two central teams for an on-the-spot assessment of the COVID-19 situation escalated on Tuesday as the panel members lay confined to guest houses for most part of the day before the state relented following a stern letter from the Union home secretary. The arrival of the teams in Kolkata without prior intimation to the state government has set off a tussle between the ruling dispensations at the Centre and in the state, with Mamata Banerjee's TMC calling the visit adventure tourism and violation of the tenets of federal structure, and the BJP accusing her government of hiding data about the pandemic. The two teams that were to tour the affected areas and interact with health workers kept cooling their heels in guest houses in Kolkata and Jalpaiguri, before the Centre intervened, with Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla shooting off a stern letter to the states chief secretary Rajiva Sinha reminding him of provisions of law and a Supreme Court order. Apurva Chandra, the leader of one of the two teams sent to the state, claimed its members were told they ""will not be going out"" on Tuesday. Chandra, an Additional secretary in the Defence Ministry, said,""We have been deployed by the central government and our order of deployment says that the state government is to provide logistic(al) support to us... I have been in touch with the chief secretary and seeking his support since the time I landed here. ""I had also met him yesterday. But today we have been informed that there are some issues so we are not going out. The chief secretary is likely to visit us and we will again hold a meeting with him,"" he told a TV news channel in Kolkata. As tensions flared, the Union home ministry intervened, with its secretary Bhalla writing to the states chief secretary that the two inter-ministerial central teams, visiting Kolkata and Jalpaiguri, have not been extended desired cooperation by the state and local authorities. ""In fact, they have been specifically restrained from making any visits, interacting with health professionals, and assessing the ground level situation. ""This amounts to obstructing the implementation of the orders issued by the central government under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and equally binding directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,"" Bhalla said. The Union home secretary said, therefore, the state government is directed to make all necessary arrangements for the central teams to carry out such responsibilities as have been entrusted to them. After the strongly worded letter from Bhalla, the team in Kolkata was allowed to visit parts of the city escorted by BSF and state police contingents. ""The central team told us that it wants to visit parts of the city. We agreed and state government officials are accompanying the team,"" Rajiva Sinha later told reporters. When pressed further whether the team would be allowed to visit other districts and how long it plans to stay in Bengal, the top bureaucrat of the state said, ""Nothing has been decided about their visit to other districts. When they come up with it (the proposal), we would take a call. About the duration of their stay, we would like to say it clearly that we have not invited them, they have come on their own. At a time when we are fighting the disease, making arrangements for their visit is tough."" Political temperature, meanwhile, soared as the TMC dubbed as ""adventure tourism"" the visit of the central teams and asked why such delegations were not sent to states with much higher number of infections and hotspots. Addressing a digital press conference, TMC MPs Derek O'Brien and Sudip Bandyopadhyay claimed that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was informed about the inter-ministerial central teams' (IMCTs) visit three hours after their arrival in the state, which they said was unacceptable. ""The IMCT is on adventure tourism. The CM was told about the team's visit three hours after the team landed,"" said O'Brien. He also questioned why central teams did not visit states such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh that have higher numbers of coronavirus cases and many more hotspots. Why central teams are being sent to West Bengal which does not appear in the list of the top 10 states in terms of infection, the TMC leader in Rajya Sabha asked. ""The Centre has to clarify. Why the chief minister was informed after the team had arrived? In a federal structure, you have to first inform the state government. The motive behind sending such teams is not yet clear. It needs to be clarified first,"" he said. The Union home ministry had said on Monday the COVID- 19 situation was ""especially serious"" in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata and a few other places in West Bengal, and formed six IMCTs for an on-the-spot assessment and issuing necessary directions to the four states - Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal. Bandyopadhyay, the leader of the Trinamool Congress in Lok Sabha, hoped that good sense would prevail and the Centre would henceforth consult the respective state before taking such a decision. ""We have kept politics behind and want a joint fight against the pandemic. Do not take our graciousness for granted, we too can talk in the political language. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah should also leave politics behind and should not take Bengal's pledge for a united fight in tackling the pandemic for granted,"" O'Brien said. ""What the central government has done by sending central teams is nothing but an insult to the people of the state, he added. Responding to a question on ""low rate of testing"" in the state, Bandyopadhyay said that 425 tests are conducted every day in West Bengal and the number from Tuesday would go up to 600. He said sending central teams is not only against the basic tenets of federalism but also amounted to diluting the joint fight against the COVID crisis. Taking umbrage at the Centre for sending teams to assess the ""serious"" COVID-19 situation in the state, the West Bengal chief minister had shot off a letter to the prime minister on Monday, calling it a ""unilateral"" and ""undesirable"" action. The BJP, however, defended the Centre's move. ""The central government has done the right thing. They (the teams) will surely find out how the lockdown norms are being violated and how the state government is trying to hide the real picture. In order to hide the facts and figures, it is pushing the people towards a much more dangerous situation,"" state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.

""Such incidents can add to stress among children especially under the current circumstances,"" Kanoongo states. He has pointed that though many states have already set-up fee regulatory system for deciding on the fee charged by the private schools, this system coupled with an effective grievance redressal mechanism will be helpful in addressing the core of such grievances.

169,"NEW DELHI: As the world faces an unprecedented disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it is time to rethink the development paradigm, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu said on Tuesday. In his message on the eve of World Earth Day, he said it is time people revisit and re-invent developmental and economic strategies. ""We must reinvent the future on more sustainable lines by drawing appropriate lessons from the past and the harsh present,"" he said. The closure of factories, industries, cancellation of flights and lesser number of vehicles plying on the roads have led to a remarkable reduction in air pollution levels, Naidu pointed out. Air pollution reportedly claims seven million lives every year globally. Hence, the need of the hour is to move increasingly towards renewable energy, green-building concept, clean technologies and the use of electric vehicles, he suggested. At the grassroots level, communities must volunteer to take up projects like tree planting on a massive scale, adopt the mantra of ""Reduce, Reuse and Recycle"" to conserve natural resources, he said.

171,"RIYADH: Saudi Arabia on Monday extended the suspension of prayers in two holy mosques-- the Grand Mosque and the Prophet's Mosque -- during the fasting month of Ramzan to prevent the spread of coronavirus. President General of the two holy mosques, Sheikh Dr. Abdulrahman bin Abdulaziz Al-Sudais, said in a tweet that Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah and Al Masjid Al-Nabawi will broadcast the call for prayer (adhan) throughout the month but would remain closed to worshippers, Arab News reported. Ramzan or Ramadan is the holiest month for Muslims throughout the world, during which the Quran- the holy text of Islam- was revealed to Prophet Muhammad by Archangel Gabriel in 610 CE. Muslims, during Ramzan, refrain from eating or drinking from sunrise to sunset. The day ends with Taraweeh, special voluntary prayer offered by the congregation. Last month, Saudi Arabia stopped people from performing prayers inside mosques in a bid to contain the spread of highly contagious coronavirus. Last week, Saudi Arabia's grand mufti Sheikh Abdulaziz al-Sheikh had asked people to offer Taraweeh during Ramzan and subsequent Eid prayers at home to prevent spreading Coronavirus. Taraweeh are night prayers that people of Islamic faith proffer during Ramzan, the Muslim holy month of fasting that starts across the world next week.

175,"NEW DELHI: Only one-third of junior staff in each of the central government offices were expected to join works from Monday, but absence of clarity on who would work on which day compelled the police to permit movement of every employee on the basis of identity cards — a situation which allowed several non-officegoers with government IDs to use this opportunity to move around. It resulted in visibly extra movement of vehicles in NDMC area and roads along CGO complex, where most of the central government offices are located, despite strict checking at multiple points. A few senior officers, who were using these stretch to get to works since the beginning of the lockdown last month, noticed this while coming to office on Monday, the first day of opening of central ministries for all seniors (deputy secretary and above) and 33% of junior work force during the current lockdown period. There were, however, instances where few ministries reported presence of more than one-third of lower rank staff in their respective departments. Underlining that it’s not possible to find out who are within those 33%, the Delhi Police special branch on Sunday wrote to all DCsP saying “all central government employees be permitted on the basis of their identity cards”. It also said all ground level staff be “briefed about it thoroughly and repeatedly” by DCsP, ACsP and SHOs. Though admin wing in respective central ministries have made roaster so that only 1/3rd of lower level staff could be called to attend office, many officials said that the arrangement would be, in any case, an informal in nature so that adequate staff are there for works on weekdays while strictly adhering to safety guidelines, including social distancing, during the lockdown period. An official said, “Roaster is prepared but non-biometric attendance made it possible for senior officials to bring their junior staff on board through an informal arrangement without compromising on safety aspect and existing guidelines. Things will be streamlined in next couple of days.” The official cited examples of seniors who are driven to office by junior staff (driver). He said the drivers would be on job all five days a week as there were not enough drivers to follow the rotation of bringing one-third on one or two days while calling others on remaining days. Some of departments dealing with essential services such as railways, agriculture, food, consumer affairs, transport and shipping saw attendance of sizeable number staff on Monday. “All those who came to office today must have got the detailed roster duty chart and there will be stricter compliance from Tuesday onwards. Dealing with files was a major concern for all those who came today,” said the other official. There were also sporadic reports where some of the staff informed their seniors that they couldn’t come as they didn’t have personal transport while some others reported about their areas falling under containment zones. Officials said most of them who attended office on Monday kept themselves confined to their rooms. In most ministries, staffs were seen standing at adequate distance while using lift.

182,"NEW DELHI: Only one-third of junior staff in each of the central government offices were expected to join works from Monday, but absence of clarity on who would work on which day compelled the police to permit movement of every employee on the basis of identity cards — a situation which allowed several non-officegoers with government IDs to use this opportunity to move around. It resulted in visibly extra movement of vehicles in NDMC area and roads along CGO complex, where most of the central government offices are located, despite strict checking at multiple points. A few senior officers, who were using these stretch to get to works since the beginning of the lockdown last month, noticed this while coming to office on Monday, the first day of opening of central ministries for all seniors (deputy secretary and above) and 33% of junior work force during the current lockdown period. There were, however, instances where few ministries reported presence of more than one-third of lower rank staff in their respective departments. Underlining that it’s not possible to find out who are within those 33%, the Delhi Police special branch on Sunday wrote to all DCsP saying “all central government employees be permitted on the basis of their identity cards”. It also said all ground level staff be “briefed about it thoroughly and repeatedly” by DCsP, ACsP and SHOs. Though admin wing in respective central ministries have made roaster so that only 1/3rd of lower level staff could be called to attend office, many officials said that the arrangement would be, in any case, an informal in nature so that adequate staff are there for works on weekdays while strictly adhering to safety guidelines, including social distancing, during the lockdown period. An official said, “Roaster is prepared but non-biometric attendance made it possible for senior officials to bring their junior staff on board through an informal arrangement without compromising on safety aspect and existing guidelines. Things will be streamlined in next couple of days.” The official cited examples of seniors who are driven to office by junior staff (driver). He said the drivers would be on job all five days a week as there were not enough drivers to follow the rotation of bringing one-third on one or two days while calling others on remaining days. Some of departments dealing with essential services such as railways, agriculture, food, consumer affairs, transport and shipping saw attendance of sizeable number staff on Monday. “All those who came to office today must have got the detailed roster duty chart and there will be stricter compliance from Tuesday onwards. Dealing with files was a major concern for all those who came today,” said the other official. There were also sporadic reports where some of the staff informed their seniors that they couldn’t come as they didn’t have personal transport while some others reported about their areas falling under containment zones. Officials said most of them who attended office on Monday kept themselves confined to their rooms. In most ministries, staffs were seen standing at adequate distance while using lift. Disinfection was also carried out in premises of many ministries, they said. DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

184,"NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government has termed the West Bengal government’s “non-cooperation” in assessing the situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state as “extremely unfortunate”. Constitutional experts also blamed the Mamata Banerjee government for creating obstacles for the central team to perform its duty. Talking to timesofindia.com, Union minorities welfare minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is authorised to take decisions in the interest of all the citizens of the country. Therefore, the states should cooperate with it. “However, instead of cooperating with NDMA, she (West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee) is creating conflict. This is extremely unfortunate,” he said. Asked what would the Centre do now that Mamata Banerjee has objected to the visit of the central team to her state, Mukktar Abbas Naqvi said, “For the Union government, welfare of the citizens of West Bengal is priority.” Constitutional expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general Subhash C Kashyap defended the Centre on constitutional grounds. He said infectious diseases are in the Concurrent List of the Constitution along with public health and National Disaster Management Act. He said, “The constitutional provisions are quite clear over the Centre’s role during the outbreak of infectious diseases. The Union government is entitled to take decisions and direct the states under Articles 256 and 257 of the Constitution. It is well within its rights to direct the states to take necessary steps on the lines indicated by it.” Asked what the Centre should do if states refuse or question the former - as in the case of West Bengal - Subhash C Kashyap said the Union government should convey to Mamata Banerjee the constitutional provisions. Earlier, the home ministry said the West Bengal government was not cooperating with the inter-ministerial central teams (IMCTs) that have gone to assess the situation in Kolkata and Jalpaiguri. The central teams have been restrained from paying visits, interacting with the health professionals and assessing the ground situation, home secretary Ajay Bhalla has said this in a letter to the West Bengal chief secretary. Prior to that, Mamata Banerjee wrote a strongly-worded letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing her concerns over the visit of the central team. She wrote, ""Respected Prime Minister, I would like to bring to your kind notice that today the Union home minister spoke to me over the telephone at about 1 pm regarding the visit of Inter-Ministerial Central Teams to my state. Unfortunately, the teams had already landed at Kolkata Airport by AI Special Cargo Flight 1701 at 10:10 am, that is much before our telephonic conversation.” “The order dated April 19, 2020, from home ministry addressed to Chief Secretary also reached 30 minutes before the teams arrived. While I appreciate the proactiveness shown by the central government in sending the teams to West Bengal, the same was done prior intimation and hence is a breach of established protocol,” Mamata Banerjee wrote. “As an established procedure, it is expected that the central team should have first taken a briefing from the state government officials prior to going for the field visits,” she said. The West Bengal CM also objected to the Centre’s observations calling them “devoid of any facts” and credibility. “For example, out of the districts identified, Kalimpong reported the last incident of infection on April 2. Similarly, the last incidents of infection reported in Jalpaiguri was on April 2 and Darjeeling on April 2,” Mamata Banerjee added. “It shows that selection of districts and observations made unilaterally are nothing but a figment of imagination and unfortunate. The state government is proactively enforcing the lockdown measures as notified by the Government of India and is maintaining a closed liaison with concerned central ministries,” she wrote. She claimed that West Bengal had displayed promptness and seriousness by announcing the extension of the lockdown from April 14 to April 30, days before the Centre’s announcement. “I am sure that you will kindly agree that such unilateral action on the part of central government is not desirable at all, especially in the backdrop when both central and state governments are working together relentlessly to contain the Covid-19 crisis,” she said.

186,"BENGALURU: A Bengaluru stem cell-based R&D and drug development firm has sought permission from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) to test a drug on Covid-19 patients in India. Stempeutics Research, part of the multi-billion-dollar Manipal Education and Medical Group, says that the drug — Stempeucel — has shown anti-inflammatory properties that would be useful in improving the lung condition of those with Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition critical Covid-19 patients are known to suffer from. BN Manohar, CEO & MD, Stempeutics, told TOI: “The research on Stempeucel has been going on for years. It works on Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI), among other kinds of ailments, which require stem cell therapy to reduce inflammation. In fact, we already have a conditional marketing approval from DCGI specifically for CLI.” The drug is based on Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) and in the wake of Covid-19 spreading, the firm did lab tests of the drug to check if it can improve lung condition and found positive results. “It has been now credibly reported that the SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing Covdi-19) affects the pulmonary system eventually leading to ARDS in critical patients. Once patients reach that stage, the fatality is 50%. Our product has shown anti-inflammatory properties that we are confident can improve the lung condition of such patients,” Manohar said. Researchers from across the world are studying the efficacy of MSC-based products and therapy. In China, 10 patients were tested — seven with MSC and three without — and those with MSC showed improvement, while tests are going on in the US too. Arguing that since the drug has been tested efficiently for other ailments like CLI, Manohar said: “While testing for other things like CLI, we have proved that the drug is safe to be used on humans, which means that we can straight away go on to testing for its efficacy against ARDS,” adding that its safety test has been conducted on 350 Indians. He further argued the need to get critical patients off ventilators as soon as possible will become a priority. “Given the fatality rates of those Covid-19 patients with ARDS, the goal is to reduce the time they spend on ventilators because prolonged dependence on the mechanical system is bad. I think this product can improve the lung condition,” he said. As on Tuesday, Stempeutics was in the process of finalising the design of the test it needs to send to DCGI. “We’ve had our discussions and now, our proposal needs to spell out the details. We need to show how many patients we need to test this on, and what kind of dosage and protocols need to be followed,” Manohar added.

ICMR on Tuesday asked states to stop using the newly-distributed Chinese rapid testing kits for the next two days after disparities in results were reported from different areas. The kits were purchased by Centre which it supplied to states. Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said in his tweet, “In view of advisory issued by @ICMR state govt has suspended Rapid Anti Body tests, for next two days.” ICMR’s head of epidemiology and communicable diseases Raman R Gangakhedkar said that in three states it was found that there was a lot of variation in the accuracy of test results of positive samples. Assam has received 9600 of these Chinese made rapid test kits from centre. Sarma said that the department wants to use these kits in medical colleges and district hospitals whenever a doctor doubts on any patient coming for general treatment, from April 24. He said that 50 kits will be used for random test at Spanish Garden apartment, which has been sealed as a containment zone after one of its residents tested positive and has now been cured on Wednesday. Another 25 kits in Athgaon Kabarsthan mosque where eight Tablighi Jamaat attendees had stayed and form where the virus was transmitted to few others and 250 kits at Lahorighat where there is a concentration of Tablighi Jamaat attendees. Sarma said that the state is also independently trying to import such kits from an ICMR-recognised Chinese company in Guangzhou province.

The home ministry also wrote to the state chief secretary directing the Bengal government to abide by the Centre's order in this regard, and make all necessary arrangements so that the IMCT can carry out its responsibilities effectively. The team, which landed here on Monday morning, held two rounds of meetings with state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha. While the first interaction took place on Monday at the state secretariat Nabanna, the second one happened at the BSF facility on Tuesday. The team, which has put up at the BSF Officers' Institute on Gurusaday Dutta Road in south Kolkata's Ballygunge area, went out briefly in the morning but returned to their base after traversing only 500 metre. Two Kolkata Police officers soon reached the institute and sought to know the team's programme for the day. The police then set up a post for checking on both ends of Gurusaday Dutta Road, and controlled vehicular movements. The centre's decision to send the team has triggered a big row, with the Trinamool Congress government of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee questioning the need for such a delegation. Banerjee shot off a letter to Prime Minister Nareandra Modi on Monday, describing the Centre's decision as ""unilateral', and alleging it was sent without prior intimation, causing 'breach of established protocol'. She also dubbed the Union government's selection of districts with 'serious' Covid-19 situation as a 'figment of imagination'. The home ministry in a communication on Monday claimed violation of lockdown measures were reported from some districts in the country posing a serious health hazard and risk for spread of Covid-19. Regarding West Bengal, it said: ""The situation is especially serious in Kolkata, Howrah, Medinipur East, North 24 Parganas, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpaiguri districts"". Adopting a tough stand, the state government had threatened not to allow the IMCT to move around in the state unless it had a clear idea about their needs or why they wanted to go for field visits.

Top food ministry functionaries said the states have full authority to decide about the beneficiaries and increasing their number. They can take as much grain as they want from the Food Corporation India (FCI) at Rs 21 (wheat) and Rs 22 (rice) a kg to distribute to these additional beneficiaries for free of cost or at subsidized rate.

However, since we are aware about the states’ requirement we are making the grains available to them. Buying grains at notified rates won’t impact their allocation from central pool, which takes care of the beneficiaries covered under NFSA,” a source said. Meanwhile, the FCI has transported about 4.42 lakh tonnes of froodgrains through 158 trains to North Eastern states, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.

This is double its average of about 80 train loads per month. Food ministry said North East has unique logistical challenges as not all areas have rail access. Out of total 86 depots operated by FCI in seven states in the region, only 38 are fed through rail movement. While entire Meghalaya depends on road transport for grain supply, only two 2 depots out of 13 in Arunachal are get supply by rail. Manipur is supported by road movement from Dimapur rail head in Nagaland. DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

210,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra government's priority is to break the chain of COVID-19 pandemic as soon as possible and lift the lockdown to get the state economy back on track, state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said on Tuesday. Maharashtra is the most-affected state in the country with the number of COVID-19 positive cases crossing 4,000 mark and death toll rising to over 200. Even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown in the country on March 25, Maharashtra had announced a lockdown from March 23, while all construction activities had come to a standstill since March 21. ""We are currently in the middle of the biggest crisis that world might have ever seen. While we, as a government, are sensitive towards the economic pain that various sectors are going through, the priority for us is to break this chain of coronavirus pandemic,"" Thackeray said during an online seminar organised by real estate apex body Naredco. He said the intent of the government is to completely lift the lockdown as soon as possible but not before it is able to break the pandemic chain. ""In my interactions with various stakeholders, I am asked two questions- when will the lockdown go and how long is it (lockdown) sustainable. The only answer to these questions is- as long as we, as a country, are successful in controlling the spread. We too are not happy to impose it but our success lies in breaking the chain. It is important to save lives first,"" Thackeray said. He said the state along with local bodies have conducted over 75,800 tests so far and only 6 per cent have tested positive. Noting that the real estate sector has been under pressure since the past few years, he said the government was committed to assisting the sector. ""Maharashtra has the largest number of industries with the largest manufacturing and services base and a vibrant housing industry. Due to demonetisation or haphazard implementation of the GST, the real estate sector has been feeling the pain, but with the new government under chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, we are working towards coming up with some solutions. I am not promising a concrete solution at this moment but we have already set up a task force which is working towards it,"" he added. Developers' associations have been demanding a one time stimulus package for the sector along with reduction in GST as well as stamp duty.

212,"Even before President Donald Trump announced that he intends to temporarily suspend immigration to the US because of Covid-19, it was becoming clear that the effect of the virus on migration would be powerful, long-lasting and unfortunate. Many countries besides the US have already shuttered or severely limited entry from foreigners — and many of those restrictions will not be so easily removed when the worst of the pandemic has passed. First, there is no guarantee that a good vaccine will be ready quickly, even within two years. There is still no vaccine, for instance, for the common cold or HIV-AIDS. Even if the US has Covid-19 under control, there might be persistent if small pockets of Covid-19 in other countries, including populous, poor countries such as India, Pakistan and Nigeria. The US may be reluctant to take new migrants from those parts of the world. Whether or not that reaction is rational, it is easy to imagine the public being fearful about the potential of immigration to contribute to a pandemic resurgence. It does seem that regions able to restrict in-migration relatively easily — such as New Zealand, Iceland and Hawaii — have had less severe Covid-19 problems. New York City, which takes in people from around the world, has had America’s most severe outbreak. And the recent appearance of a second wave of Covid-19 in Singapore has been connected to ongoing migration there. I have never thought the federal government would build Trump’s wall on the US-Mexico border. But now I wonder whether it may well happen — perhaps in electronic form. There is another side to this issue, of course: Many countries may decide to continue to limit visitors from the US The American government might then respond by restricting in-migration from those countries. This kind of tit-for-tat retaliation is not always rational, but it is a pretty common phenomenon in international relations. Alternatively, maybe many poorer (and richer?) countries will acquire “herd immunity” even without good access to a vaccine. But that will be hard to prove, and the casualties that mount along the way may scare the US public away from allowing more immigration from those countries, even if their citizens end up as safer bets than Americans. In recent times China had been the largest source of immigrants to the US These days it is difficult to imagine a member of the US Congress taking to the floor and demanding that America open its shores to the Chinese once again, no matter what the actual level of safety. In addition to these effects, many migrants currently living in the US might go back home. Say you are from southern India and live in Atlanta, and typically your parents or grandparents come to visit once a year. That is now much harder for them to do, and will be for the foreseeable future. India also might make it more difficult for Indian-Americans to return to visit their relatives, perhaps demanding an immunity certificate for entry. Many of these current migrants will end up returning home to live in their native countries. Even if a vaccine comes along in a few years, restrictions on immigrants will have become the legal status quo — and in a democracy with a lot of checks and balances, status-quo bias can be very strong. Those restrictions are not likely to be reversed very quickly. In spite of all those possible restrictions, the pandemic itself may offer new reasons to embrace some forms of migration, if only to help Western economies continue to function. Many jobs are now more dangerous than before, because they involve face-to-face contact and time spent in enclosed spaces. Such professions as nursing and dental assistants, for example, already attracted many immigrants even before Covid-19. Working on farms may yet become more perilous if the virus strikes farm worker communities. New migrants from poorer countries will be willing to take on these risks — for extra income of course — but most US citizens won’t go near them. The reality may be an uptick in some forms of migration, mostly for relatively hazardous jobs. There could be a national guest-worker program, managed by quota by profession, to ensure that such jobs are filled. It is a little-known fact that last month the US government eased H-2 visa rules, in part to make it easier for Mexican farm workers to enter this country and work to secure the food supply chain. And this was from an administration not favorable to greater immigration. So yes, immigration is likely to remain at depressed levels for years to come. At the same time, businesses will probably continue to furtively appeal for foreign workers for dangerous sectors, hire them and then keep many of them at arm’s length from mainstream American society. That, at least as much as any reduction in overall levels, could be what the next wave of immigration looks like.

213,"CHANDIGARH: Pointing to the alarming gap between the state’s anticipated receipt and committed expenditure, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday demanded from Centre an interim compensation to the tune of Rs 3000 crore for the month of April on account of the COVID-19 national disaster.  In a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, Amarinder also asked for expediting the release of the state’s GST arrears of Rs 4400 crore for the last four months, to help the state overcome its resource constraint.  Citing the lockdown that had substantial fiscal consequences for all states, Amarinder said the Centre should compensate Punjab for its loss of revenue due to COVID-19. While the Rs 3000 crore for April was an estimate, he said “detailed assessment of loss and requirement of funds for relief and rehabilitation will be submitted in due course.” However, he stressed, “the Government of India should provide interim assistance so that the fight against COVID-19 is not allowed to weaken in any way.” He added that Punjab was facing a huge stress on state exchequer on account of the required health and relief measures that are being continuously scaled up, “with hardly any revenue receipts accruing to the state during these days due to near complete shutdown of trade, business and industry.” Amarinder observed that receipts expected for April were expected to decline sharply as most economic activities in the state remain closed on account of the lockdown. The receipts on account of SGST, IGST, and VAT, excise, stamp duty and motor vehicle taxes are almost negligible and the reduced electricity consumption has resulted in a drop of 60% of the expected revenue from electricity duty during April 2020, he noted.  In addition, said Amarinder, the GST compensation of approximately Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months - from December, 2019 to March, 2020 - was also pending for disbursement by the Union Government.  On the other hand, he pointed out, the committed expenditure - debt servicing, pensions, salaries, relief measures for COVID-19, health care and infrastructure etc., is budgeted at Rs 7,301 crore for the month of April 2020. Pointing to the critical fiscal situation of the state, Amarinder also sought the Centre’s permission to allow sale of liquor, in a phased manner, to mop up VAT and excise revenue. The Ministry of Home, GoI, should “allow the state to take a conscious decision to allow the sale of liquor in certain areas in a phased manner with strict social distancing and other measures to prevent COVID-19,” he said. This, said Amarinder, would help the state immensely in its efforts to scale up the relief and health care measures to combat COVID-19 and meet some, if not all, of its committed liabilities and other day-to-day expenses.

214,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan has removed over almost 3,800 names from its terror watch list quietly, raising concerns that important terrorists are being protected by the state despite being on the FATF’s enhanced grey list. According to a US risk compliance company, Castellum AI, (first covered by the Wall Street Journal) in October 2018, Pakistan’s terrorist watchlist, the Proscribed Persons List, had about 7,600 names. A note by Castellum said, “Between March 9 and March 27, Castellum.AI data showed that Pakistan removed 1,069 names from the Proscribed Persons List, and that all those names then appeared on the country’s Denotified List, a term used in Pakistan to signify an official removal. Since March 27th, about 800 more names were removed from the terrorist watchlist and placed on the Denotified List. Since its peak, about 3,800 names were removed from the Proscribed Persons List, without explanation or notification to the public.” Contrary to reports, however, while the latest list does not include the name of Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi, the original list did not either — according to Indian security officials, Pakistan had never put Lakhvi’s name on its proscribed list. Both Maulana Masood Azhar and Lakhvi are “protected” assets of the Pakistani military-intelligence state. The latest list includes both Hafiz Saeed (No 1069) and Maulana Masood Azhar (No 1635). Sources here said top terror leaders like Masood Azhar (QDi.422), Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi (QDi.264), Dawood Ibrahim (QDi.115), leaders of the Haqqani Network, still remain free and active, with not even one criminal charge against them. Until 2019, Pakistan had told FATF that all of its about 7,600 terrorists, under Schedule 4 of its Anti Terrorist Act, were under close monthly monitoring of its police stations. Their bank accounts were frozen but they were allowed to earn separately. But, if their bank accounts had been frozen and with terror designations, they cannot operate new accounts, they would obviously be storing money in cash, which would be another concern about terror financing. Pakistan’s case is expected to be reviewed by the FATF in June, but with the Covid pandemic showing no signs of abating, its anyone’s guess whether the FATF plenary can be held then. Sources say it could move back to September, which will keep Pakistan in the enhanced grey list until then. In the last review, Pakistan was deemed to have made progress on 14 out of 27 point action plan it was supposed to execute. Sources said there continue to be 130-odd UN-designated terrorists, of which Pakistan claims there are only 16 on its territory, while seven are dead. Pakistan says it has no idea of the location of 114 of them. According to Indian sources, Pakistan has removed a big chunk of names from its proscribed list because the burden of tracking them and acting against them would be too much. The Castellum.AI note focused on a name Zaka-ur Rehman, which they believe is close enough to Zakiur Rehman. But Indian officials say all his aliases are covered in the UNSC designation. “In the case of Zaka Ur Rehman, the difference between Zaka and Zaki fits within the parameters of an accurate phonetic translation. Castellum.AI also searched for the Lashkar E Taiba leader’s full name, Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi, on the Pakistan Proscribed Persons list, and he was not on the list. This means that if the removed name is a false positive, that Pakistan has not added the Lashkar E Taiba leader to its terrorism watchlist.” DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest India NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

Their opposition was due to a misconception that the contagion may spread in their neighbourhood if the virus victim's burial took place.

237,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would not get into budgetary or financial domain of the Union government by directing it to pay basic minimum wages to migrant workers during the lockdown period, as demanded in PILs by rights activists Harsh Mander, Swami Agnivesh and others. Another PIL sought a direction to the state governments to pay minimum wages to self-employed workers like rickshaw pullers, auto-drivers, etc. But a bench of Justices N V Ramana, S K Kaul and B R Gavai wondered how the courts could direct the Centre to give money to states for this purpose/ ""Are we experts in such matters? These are elected governments at the states and Centre having a mandate to govern. We are not getting into the issues of financial support and adequacy or inadequacy of funds,"" it said. Appearing for rights activists, advocate Prashant Bhushan cited a study conducted on 11,000 migrant workers and said nearly 90% of them said that they have neither got any ration or cooked food from the governments. He said the 2011 census estimated population of migrant labourers to be 4 crore, but the Centre said it has provided shelter and food to 15 lakh. ""It is a mockery of social distancing in the crowded shelters. The Centre's claim that it has transferred Rs 500 per month to women having Jan Dhan accounts is inadequate. The government recognised the need for monthly payment to migrant workers. That is why they asked the private employers to pay their workers. Nearly 90% of the workers said they have not been paid during the lockdown period. Government said it would pay Rs 5,000 to each construction worker. But they constitute a very small minority of the population,"" Bhushan said, demanding minimum wage payment to migrant workers during lockdown period. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta came out all guns blazing during the video-conference hearing and rubbished the petitioners' claim about migrant workers going hungry. ""Who told petitioners that no worker has been paid? Who conducted the survey that showed that workers are hungry? What have the petitioners done so far to help migrant labourers? The government, apart from transferring money to the needy, has given benefits under the direct transfer schemes. Around 50,000 NGOs are working shoulder to shoulder with governments to provide food and basic needs to migrant workers, poor and destitute during lockdown period. But there are some rights activists whose social work is confined to filing PILs."" Mehta added that helpline numbers across the country are being monitored actively by two ministers of state and the home minister. ""Anyone seeking food gets it within an hour of making a grievance on the helpline. The petitioners have not specified which worker they represented and who is going hungry,"" he told the bench. While questioning the veracity of the survey cited by the rights activists, the Justice Ramana-led bench said, ""In a situation like this, the court cannot say whether some task has to be done one way or the other. It is an unusual situation. Someone may say something is not working well. But everyone is trying to do their best."" The bench disposed of the petition saying the petition and accompanying material will be considered as a representation by the Centre to take steps it deemed necessary to help the lot of migrant workers.

Attorney general K K Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices N V Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai that militancy still poses a grave threat to peace in the Kashmir valley and that it would be inappropriate to start the high-speed internet services at this juncture. ""Recently a militant was killed by security forces. Nearly 500 persons attended the funeral despite lockdown,"" the AG said. Justice Ramana-led bench asked petitioners whether the J&K HC had sum moth taken up internet services issue and as to what happened in the case. A petitioner's counsel, Huzefa Ahmadi, told the bench that the HC had taken up a whole gamut of issues, including internet services. ""Our specific issue is that in the absence of 4G services it is difficult to hold video conferencing, which hampers doctors from consulting other experts and give advice to their patients, the professionals cannot enter into any contract for supply and purchase of food produce and material, and nearly 2,200 private schools have been hampered in their effort to provide online classes to their students,"" he said. The SC had sought response of the J&K administration on April 10 on a petition filed by an association of journalists. Two subsequent PILs were filed by a lawyer and 'Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir', which complained that in the absence of 4G it could not impart online instructions to its students, as was being done by private schools in other states. The association of private schools also said that non-provision of 4G services violated the fundamental right to education of children. The school association's counsel told the court that about 2,200 private schools are unable to hold online classes jeopardising ongoing academic session of 22 lakh students, most of whom have tabs or laptops but there is no 4G internet connectivity required for online classes. SC asked the J&K agovernment and the Centre to file a detailed affidavit on this issue and said it would take up hearing on Monday.

Joint secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Punya Salila Srivastava, said home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote fresh communication to the states as some of them were issuing certain guidelines that amounted to ""diluting"" the lockdown leading to ""severe repercussions to health"" of the citizens. ""MHA is regularly monitoring the lockdown situation in the country. Wherever lockdown is being violated we (MHA) are taking adequate action in coordinationÂ with state governments,"" she said while briefing reporters about the updates on lockdown measures being implemented across the country. ""Yesterday, MHA again wrote letter to states and UTs that guidelines issued by it under the disaster management Act are to be followed strictly,"" she said. ""They (states and UTs) can undertake stricter steps as per their local conditions but not dilute or weaken them,"" she added. Writing this letter became important, she said, as in some states facilities were being allowed which were not permitted under the MHA guidelines. The ministry also wrote to the Kerala government about the directives issued by the state and expressedÂ its concerns over it, she said. The ministry, through a letter written by Bhalla to Kerala chief secretary Tom Jose, came down heavily on the state government for its decision to allow opening of restaurants, bus travel in cities and opening of MSME industries in urban areas, saying it amounts to dilution of lockdown guidelines and also a Supreme Court observation. Srivastava said that some things, mentioned in the Kerala-issued order, violated MHA guildelines issued under the disaster management Act and was tantamount to ""diluting the lockdown."" They were requested that national guidelines should be followed, she said. Also, attention was drawn towards the Supreme Court observation of March 31 where it said that all state governments and people should follow the central government's directives with honesty and dedication and in letter and spirit. The MHA officer said it was found that some districts in other states were also violating the lockdown and that can have ""severe repercussions for health."" In some districts, she said, the COVID-19 situation is grave or is inching towards that. Srivastava identified these districts as Jaipur in Rajasthan, Indore in Madhya Pradesh, Mumbai and Pune in Maharashtra, Kolkata, Howrah, North 24 Parganas,Â Medinipur East, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Kalimpong in West Bengal. She said six inter-ministerial teams have been formed by the MHA for visiting the above mentioned four states and they have now reached their respective locations. These teams are led by an additional secretary-rank officer of the central government and each of them have six members comprising a senior public health specialist and an official from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), she said. The MHA's effort is to ensure that all available expertise, as far as possible, should be shared with the states in the interest of the people. These teams will assess the hotspot areas, health and medical infrastructure management, issues related to disaster management and will ""cooperate"" with the states. They will give a report on the lockdown rules and supply of essential goods, social distancing norms, health services and security of health workers and also check the status of relief camps being run for poor and labourers in these states. ""The purpose of the inter-ministerial teams is to provide support and assistanceÂ to the states in their endeavour to combat COVID-19,"" she said. ""The teams have been very carefully constituted so that support can be provided from health, administrative and disaster management aspects and I am sure states will benefit from it,"" she added.

255,"NEW DELHI: States and Union territories (UTs) can take stricter action than what is mentioned in the guidelines issued by the central government to enforce the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 but cannot dilute or weaken them, the Union home ministry said on Monday. Joint secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Punya Salila Srivastava, said home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote fresh communication to the states as some of them were issuing certain guidelines that amounted to ""diluting"" the lockdown leading to ""severe repercussions to health"" of the citizens. ""MHA is regularly monitoring the lockdown situation in the country. Wherever lockdown is being violated we (MHA) are taking adequate action in coordinationÂ with state governments,"" she said while briefing reporters about the updates on lockdown measures being implemented across the country. ""Yesterday, MHA again wrote letter to states and UTs that guidelines issued by it under the disaster management Act are to be followed strictly,"" she said. ""They (states and UTs) can undertake stricter steps as per their local conditions but not dilute or weaken them,"" she added. Writing this letter became important, she said, as in some states facilities were being allowed which were not permitted under the MHA guidelines. The ministry also wrote to the Kerala government about the directives issued by the state and expressedÂ its concerns over it, she said. The ministry, through a letter written by Bhalla to Kerala chief secretary Tom Jose, came down heavily on the state government for its decision to allow opening of restaurants, bus travel in cities and opening of MSME industries in urban areas, saying it amounts to dilution of lockdown guidelines and also a Supreme Court observation. Srivastava said that some things, mentioned in the Kerala-issued order, violated MHA guildelines issued under the disaster management Act and was tantamount to ""diluting the lockdown."" They were requested that national guidelines should be followed, she said. Also, attention was drawn towards the Supreme Court observation of March 31 where it said that all state governments and people should follow the central government's directives with honesty and dedication and in letter and spirit. The MHA officer said it was found that some districts in other states were also violating the lockdown and that can have ""severe repercussions for health."" In some districts, she said, the COVID-19 situation is grave or is inching towards that. Srivastava identified these districts as Jaipur in Rajasthan, Indore in Madhya Pradesh, Mumbai and Pune in Maharashtra, Kolkata, Howrah, North 24 Parganas,Â Medinipur East, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Kalimpong in West Bengal. She said six inter-ministerial teams have been formed by the MHA for visiting the above mentioned four states and they have now reached their respective locations. These teams are led by an additional secretary-rank officer of the central government and each of them have six members comprising a senior public health specialist and an official from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), she said. The MHA's effort is to ensure that all available expertise, as far as possible, should be shared with the states in the interest of the people. These teams will assess the hotspot areas, health and medical infrastructure management, issues related to disaster management and will ""cooperate"" with the states. They will give a report on the lockdown rules and supply of essential goods, social distancing norms, health services and security of health workers and also check the status of relief camps being run for poor and labourers in these states. ""The purpose of the inter-ministerial teams is to provide support and assistanceÂ to the states in their endeavour to combat COVID-19,"" she said. ""The teams have been very carefully constituted so that support can be provided from health, administrative and disaster management aspects and I am sure states will benefit from it,"" she added. We hope that with these steps, we will be successful in the mission against coronavirus, the officer said.
